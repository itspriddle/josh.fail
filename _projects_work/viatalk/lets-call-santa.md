letscallsanta.com is a free service that lets children leave a voicemail for
Santa to let him know what they'd like for Christmas. The voicemail is
delivered to parents via email and can be shared on Facebook and Twitter or
made public on the letscallsanta.com site. The web application was designed
using CodeIgniter, MySQL, and jQuery; in 2009 I rewrote the application in
Ruby on Rails. This project was initially completed in about 1 week and
remains one of my favorite projects I've worked on.

<!--
**Biggest Challenge:** I built a basic version of this with a coworker without
asking anyone and fully expected it to never be used.

**Biggest Triumph:** Getting approval and company resources to do this well
was great --- but the best part was how much the recordings (shared with
parental permission) made everyone in the office laugh.
