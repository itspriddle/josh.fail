<!--
**Biggest Challenge:** I wasn't given DB access initially and had to resort to
scraping XML feeds to pull some of the data. This was also the first time I
worked on a custom browser extension.

**Biggest Triumph:** This is the project that started to convince my bosses
that I should focus more on application development.
