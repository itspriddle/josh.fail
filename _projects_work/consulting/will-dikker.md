I was the lead consultant for a local startup, Will Dikker, which provides a
marketplace for used cars, trucks, and more. Users receive free Will Dikker
Stikkers with an SMS shortcode that can be texted for more information on an
item. I handled all backend development on the Rails application, including
integration with Air2Web for SMS communications, billing via Authorize.net,
and server setup.

<!--
**Biggest Challenge:** Members of the startup came from a print background
and we didn't always agree on my interpretation of design mockups. I learned
quickly that sussing out what level of pixel perfect design a client is
expecting is hugely important.

**Biggest Triumph:** Implementing the SMS gateway and seeing car details from
my DB show up on my phone was pretty fun.
