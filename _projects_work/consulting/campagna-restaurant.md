I worked with Allusis Productions to automate the deployment process for
Campagna Restaurant. A traditional PHP deployment left the site open to
possible bugs and downtime. I configured the existing application to support
staging and production environments, automated deploys, caching, and easy
backups. I also setup monitoring and integration testing to help avoid
downtime.
