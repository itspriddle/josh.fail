DotBlock Mobile is an iPhone application that allows customers to manage their
accounts and VPSs. The iPhone application was designed using Appcelerator
Titanium. The supporting API was designed using Ruby and Sinatra, and is
responsible for fetching customer info and issuing commands to VPS
hypervisors. I also worked on public documentation for the API and implemented
wrappers in several languages to allow DotBlock customers to easily build
software around their VPSs.
