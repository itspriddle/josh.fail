Ennouncement is a web application that allows users to broadcast important
voice messages to groups of users. The web application was designed using Ruby
on Rails, MySQL and jQuery. I also worked on integrating this service with the
ViaTalk Control Panel to allow ViaTalk customers to use call broadcasting
features.

<!--
**Biggest Challenge:** Once the base Ennouncement project was wrapped, we
wanted the functionality present in ViaTalk. Integrating the two systems was a
bit of a challenge, but thankfully it used shared VoIP infrastructure.

**Biggest Triumph:** This project was 6 months behind schedule when I took on
development. I was able to implement the originally scoped application in
about a week.
