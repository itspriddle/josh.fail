Ennouncement is a web application that allows users to broadcast important
voice messages to groups of users. The web application was designed using Ruby
on Rails, MySQL and jQuery. I also worked on integrating this service with the
ViaTalk Control Panel to allow ViaTalk customers to use call broadcasting
features.

<!--
I created the web and iPhone applications for
<a href="http://www.ennouncement.com/">Ennouncement</a>, a call
broadcasting service. The web application was created using Ruby on
Rails, and the iPhone application was created using Titanium Mobile.

My work with Ennouncement Mobile was especially challenging (and fun)
as it was the first iPhone application I've developed. My work with
Titanium Mobile has been extracted into a helper library,
<a href="https://github.com/itspriddle/ti-figher">TiFighter</a>.

**Biggest Challenge:** Once the base Ennouncement project was wrapped, we
wanted the functionality present in ViaTalk. Integrating the two systems was a
bit of a challenge, but thankfully it used shared VoIP infrastructure.

**Biggest Triumph:** This project was 6 months behind schedule when I took on
development. I was able to implement the originally scoped application in
about a week.
