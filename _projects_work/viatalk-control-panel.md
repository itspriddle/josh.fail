ViaTalk Control Panel (cp.viatalk.com) is a web application that allows
customers to sign up and manage their services, and allows staff to manage
customers and services. The application was designed using Ruby on Rails,
MySQL and jQuery and was tightly integrated with the ViaTalk VoIP platform. I
joined the project after its initial development, and was the sole developer
responsible for ongoing maintenance, security updates, and implementation of
new features. I migrated the project's code repository from SVN to Git and
improved average deploy times from over 10 minutes to under 30 seconds.

<!--
**Biggest Challenge:** I really didn't know Ruby or Rails when I took over
this project. Fixing serious bugs and trying to add new features can be
difficult when you're learning a language and a framework.

**Biggest Triumph:** Speed improvements across the board from deployment
speeds to call record retrieval to playing voicemail.
