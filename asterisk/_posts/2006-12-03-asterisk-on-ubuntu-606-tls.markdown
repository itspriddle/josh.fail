title: Asterisk on Ubuntu 6.06 TLS
---
It took forever, but this ended up working to get Asterisk to compile:

`apt-get install libssl-dev libncurses5-dev libspeex-dev sox sox-dev build-essential manpages-dev libasound2-dev ssh linux-headers-2.6.15-23-server`

Fuck Fedora.

I'm having trouble getting the required MySQL Perl mods installed so I can use Mysql with Asterisk... but I guess I'll figure it out sooner or later
