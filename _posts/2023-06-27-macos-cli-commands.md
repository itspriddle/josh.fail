I saw this list of [macOS CLI Commands][1]. I knew about most of these, and
use many like `pbcopy` and `pbpaste` often.

`sips` looks pretty neat---I've usually just whipped up quick Ruby scripts
with the `mini_magick` gem.

Hopefully people comment with a few more goodies in the [Hacker News
comments][2].
