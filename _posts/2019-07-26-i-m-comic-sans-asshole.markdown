    Listen up.

      I know the shit you've been saying behind my back.
    </a>
    You think I'm stupid. You think I'm immature. You think I'm a malformed,
    pathetic excuse for a font. Well think again, nerdhole, because I'm Comic
    Sans, and I'm the best thing to happen to typography since Johannes
    fucking Gutenberg.

    You don't like that your coworker used me on that note about stealing her
    yogurt from the break room fridge? You don't like that I'm all over your
    sister-in-law's blog? You don't like that I'm on the sign for that new
    Thai place? You think I'm pedestrian and tacky? Guess the fuck what,
    Picasso. We don't all have seventy-three weights of stick-up-my-ass
    Helvetica sitting on our seventeen-inch MacBook Pros. Sorry the entire
    world can't all be done in stark Eurotrash Swiss type. Sorry some people
    like to have fun. Sorry I'm standing in the way of your minimalist
    Bauhaus-esque fascist snoozefest. Maybe sometime you should take off your
    black turtleneck, stop compulsively adjusting your Tumblr theme, and
    lighten the fuck up for once.

    People love me. Why? Because I'm fun. I'm the life of the party. I bring
    levity to any situation. Need to soften the blow of a harsh message about
    restroom etiquette? SLAM. There I am. Need to spice up the directions to
    your graduation party? WHAM. There again. Need to convey your fun-loving,
    approachable nature on your business' website? SMACK. Like daffodils in
    motherfucking spring.
  </p>

  <p>
    When people need to kick back, have fun, and party, I will be there,
    unlike your pathetic fonts. While Gotham is at the science fair, I'm
    banging the prom queen behind the woodshop. While Avenir is practicing the
    clarinet, I'm shredding "Reign In Blood" on my double-necked Stratocaster.
    While Univers is refilling his allergy prescriptions, I'm racing my
    tricked-out, nitrous-laden Honda Civic against Tokyo gangsters who'll kill
    me if I don't cross the finish line first. I am a sans serif Superman and
    my only kryptonite is pretentious buzzkills like you.
  </p>

  <p>
    It doesn't even matter what you think. You know why, jagoff? Cause I'm
    famous. I am on every major operating system since Microsoft fucking Bob.
    I'm in your signs. I'm in your browsers. I'm in your instant messengers.
    I'm not just a font. I am a force of motherfucking nature and I will not
    rest until every uptight armchair typographer cock-hat like you is
    surrounded by my lovable, comic-book inspired, sans-serif badassery.
  </p>

  <p>
    Enough of this bullshit. I'm gonna go get hammered with Papyrus.
