I've been officially a manager for just over two years now, and I think I am
ready to start rambling about some of the things I've learned along the way.
First up, setting a good work/life balance with your team.

A lot of organizations preach all about healthy work/life balance, but they
don't really _practice_ it. For teams of developers/engineers or other
knowledge workers, there is absolutely no excuse for it --- especially with
remote workers.

It doesn't have to be like this. And the cool part, is as a manager, you are
the one who can help. Here are a few rules for you:

- Your reports work 40 hours a week. Period. They might need to help with an
  issue and work 10 hours on Monday. It is on you to encourage them to work a
  shorter day that week to make up the time.
- Approve all reasonable PTO requests by default (if the person has the hours
  available). **NEVER** refuse PTO because of being short staffed. That is
  your problem, not theirs. 
- Encourage people to work early or late to make up for doctors appointments
  instead of wasting PTO on routine things.
- Encourage a total disconnect from work on PTO --- no Slack, email, etc. This
  can be difficult in remote places, with developers and engineers. A lot of
  us are friends with our coworkers and like to chat. Devs and engineers
  usually enjoy their work, and might use their PTO to work on a pet project.
  Don't be a jerk, but discourage this. It is important that people can fully
  disconnect from work; they should know it is important to _you_.
- Accept the fact your reports might need to duck out for a few minutes to
  deal with family, perhaps even daily. If this amounts to ~30 minutes, don't
  be a jerk and ask them to make up the time. Smokers don't usually stay late
  to cover for their breaks, do they?
- Seriously, stop fucking Slacking/texting/emailing your people after hours.
  Unless they are oncall, there is no reason for you to bug people off the
  clock.
- Encourage your reports to keep Slack and work email off of their phones.
- If someone is on PTO, the only reason you should bug them is if your team or
  the company will suffer irreparable harm otherwise. An emergency is one
  where your team/company will suffer irreparable harm if that person isn't
  brought in. A lack of preparation on your part is not an emergency on theirs.
- Encourage your reports to find replacements for their oncall rotations
  that fall during their PTO. They shouldn't be on the pager on vacation. They
  can be trusted to find coverage themselves.
- Avoid doing too much after hours _yourself_. If you are constantly sending
  emails at 2am, messaging people at all hours, and generally _never_
  disconnecting from work, your reports are going to think you expect the same
  thing from _them_. 
- Lunchtime is not for working. It is for food and unplugging for a bit. Stop
  scheduling meetings during lunch. Stop letting people eat at their desks
  while working. 
- If they wake up early, you do too. Our work is always going to require
  coordinating big upgrades and feature rollouts. It often makes sense to do
  these earlier in the day. 
- Set clear expectations around when and how you want people to call out for
  the day or to submit PTO. It might surprise you, in spite of everything I
  wrote above, that it really grinds me gears when people miss our daily
  standup. But, I let my team know that I need to hear about absences by that
  meeting, and they do it. It probably helps that I am pretty laid back about
  PTO otherwise.

This is the one hill I will die on when it comes to remote
developer/engineering work. Do your part, fellow manager.
