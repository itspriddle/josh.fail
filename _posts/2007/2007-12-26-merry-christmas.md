title: Merry Christmas!

Christmas was an absolute blast, as it is every year.

I'm typing this from one of my favorite presents my parents got me, my new Das
Keyboard.

Das Keyboard

As always, I watched A Christmas Story about 6 or 7 times. That movie is
simply one of the best Christmas movies of all time. At work on Christmas Eve,
we watched Home Alone 1 and 2 as well as Dutch to keep in the holiday spirit.
Xmas movies pwn!

Although I would give anything to be a little kid with the rest of the week
off -- I have a new friend to keep me company at work.

Until next time...
