title: Ogle that <BODY>...

Saw this in <a href="http://www.allusis.net">Tony's</a> aim profile tonight,
and it was so genius I had to save it here.

> Sure, you can ogle her &lt;BODY&gt; - stare at her &lt;FORM&gt;, but for
crying out loud, use your &lt;HEAD&gt;! &lt;A&gt; woman doesn't want to be
treated as an &lt;OBJECT&gt;. You've got to have &lt;STYLE&gt;. Work on your
pickup lines, don't read from some &lt;SCRIPT&gt;. Be &lt;BOLD&gt;, and take
chances! Make sure each &lt;BUTTON&gt; on your shirt is done up right.
&lt;SELECT&gt; a nice cologne, but not too much! Follow these simple
instructions, stay in the right &lt;FRAME&gt; of mind, and &lt;I&gt; am sure
you'll soon be a &lt;LEGEND&gt;
