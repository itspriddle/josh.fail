title: Twilight Princess (Part 2)
---

For the first 10 hours, I was really having fun. It got [what I thought was]
difficult in spots - but now I am at the Goron Mines, and it's really pissing
me off...

First, _actually_ getting there, took me about an hour and a half. I died
probably 10 times before I figured out how to do it.Â Springboarding off of
Gorons is fun and all, but it gets old after a half hour.

Now the mines, with the molten hot lava --- they really suck. In fact, they
suck a lot.

Well, as much as I bitch, that's the stuff I look for in a good game. And
thus far, this really is the **best** Zelda ever...
