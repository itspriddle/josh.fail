title: Fireworks CS3
---

First, I can't say how happy I am that Adobe has decided to continue
developing Fireworks after the Macromedia merger. That was my biggest concern
a year ago when I first heard the news.

CS3 has a few new feature which I'm sure I'll enjoy, such as a Pages feature
(to allow you to have different mockups, its supposed to save filesize on the
PNG if done correctly), and finally Sublayers. I've been wanting those for
years.

They've also integrated the Photoshop styles pallete as a new style you can
add to a shape. I'm not a big fan of premade bevels (they just never look
right), but the PS dropshadow tool is definitely nicer than that of FW.

Although its not quite a feature, Adobe has included several Styles that we're
never a part of the originial FW styles. A few are very nice, but they've
never been something I use much.

All in all, there are a few nice features added with this release, but its
fundamentally the same as its predecessors (6-8).
