title: Rock the Bells 2007 at Randall's Island
---

Or, more specifically, Rage Against the Machine at Rock the Bells was the best
concert I have had the privilege of attending --- period.

I don't know what else to say than that. The 8 hours of rain was no fun at
all. Three bucks for beer and seven for any food item wasn't fun either. But
when RATM hit the stage it was all worth it. They played all of their best
songs, and closed the night out with Killing in the Name. The performance was
excellent --- they weren't a group of people who got paid a ton of money to do
a reunion show. They all seemed to thoroughly enjoy playing together again. On
a side note --- Tom Morello is absolutely insane on a guitar...

Leaving sucked --- a bum had broken into Eric's car and stolen some soda and
chips. I'm serious...

All in all, it was a great time.
