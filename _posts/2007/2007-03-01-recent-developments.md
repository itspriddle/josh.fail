Wow, its really been a long time since I've updated this...Â  I had my 22nd
birthday in Jan, and passed the 1 year mark at ViaTalk.

In the last few months, Movierack.net has been totally redone. Still not quite
perfect, but it's slowly coming along.

I'm really starting to get the "I need a new layout" bug. Maybe it will happen
soon...
