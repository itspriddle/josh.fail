I just had a hell of a time trying to unzip a bunch of zip's on Linux.

Long story short, to unzip all zip files in a directory run `unzip \*.zip`

You can use `-o` to overwrite files with the same filename without being
prompted, or `-n` to never overwrite files.

I'll need this later... I'm sure.
