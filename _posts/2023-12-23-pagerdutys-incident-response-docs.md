I came across [PagerDuty's Incident Response docs][1] today and was impressed
by the depth of the content. It's a great resource for anyone who is
interested in learning more about incident response.

_I let GitHub Copilot write the intro..._ Not bad, but not my voice at all.

Anyway... this is a pretty good resource. I kind of want to fork it and tweak
it for my team at A2 ðŸ¤”
