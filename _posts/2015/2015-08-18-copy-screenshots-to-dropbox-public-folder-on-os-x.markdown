In 2013 Dropbox added the ability to [save your screenshots in Dropbox][] This
is an awesome feature that I've used almost daily since it was announced. It's
always annoyed me you can't configure this to use your [Dropbox Public
Folder][]. I finally came up with a way to do this using [launchd][]. Head on
over to the [README][dropbox-screenshots-plist] for more info on how to set it
up on your own system.
