Revenge of the Sith was fucking amazing. Anakin Skywalker decimates all.

Oh how I wish I had a lightsabre, so I might slice in two all who dare oppose
me.

Now we have some ST: Deep Space 9 action, but its not as good as The Next
Generation.

Yeah... take care. Inglenook is getting finished today. And I have a new
boring job at Ticketmaster starting Monday.

Whoooooo.........
