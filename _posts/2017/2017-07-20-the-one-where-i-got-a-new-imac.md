title: The One Where I Got A New iMac
---

I bought a new iMac to replace [my aging MacBook Pro][2013 MacBook Pro].
Here's a post where I gush about it.

My old laptop still performs pretty well for the work I do (Rails/WordPress
development). When I bought the Retina screen, though, I didn't realize I'd be
ruined for any other monitor and be stuck on a 15" laptop screen for 4 years.
I've tried a couple non-Retina monitors, and the fuzziness of text prevented
me from using them for any real work. At best, an external monitor on my 2013
MacBook was good for playing video.

Unfortunately the early 2013 MacBooks came _just_ before support for UHD
monitors existed. It could run a 4K screen at 30Hz, but performance was an
issue for a lot of people when I was looking into buying one. In the end, I
decided it would be better to wait to upgrade the computer itself before
buying a screen.

During my pixel agony, Apple released the first iMacs with Retina screens. I
was _very_ tempted to buy one of these. I've learned, though, that brand new
technology in Apple products can be a bit problematic, so I held off. I'm glad
I did, because I've seen a lot of issues reported with them. So I waited,
hoping Apple would release a Retina Thunderbolt Display. Patiently, I waited.
And waited. Until last year they announced an _LG_ screen and discontinuation
of the Thunderbolt Display. I cried a little inside, and continued on with my
15" MacBook.

I'm getting off topic. Anyway, when Apple refreshed the iMac lineup in June
2017, I knew I was ready to buy one. I deliberated the purchase for about a
day before giving in. Then I waited even more --- 3 weeks total to receive it.

## Specs

The thing about Retina pixels is they're addicting. On Amazon Prime Day, I
found a 4K Samsung screen. I knew it wouldn't be on par with the iMac's Retina
display, but had hoped it wouldn't be totally unusable for me. As soon as I
plugged it in I knew it wasn't going to work out --- it was nowhere close to
the iMac screen. After a couple days using it, I knew this screen would end up
being another expensive video player I couldn't code on, so I packed it up to
return to Amazon.

A coworker picked up the LG UltraFine 5K Display for use with a 2017 MacBook
Pro. I grilled him about the image quality, and spent about 4 hours this time
deliberating the purchase. Given the pretty hefty price tag for a monitor, I'm
very excited to say this screen _is_ on par with the iMac screen. 

In the span of 3 weeks I've gone from a single 15" laptop screen --- which I
was 90% happy with --- to two 27" screens. One thing I didn't anticipate was
having to adjust my workflows for two screens. I haven't quite figured out
where I like my editor, my browser, Slack, Mail, etc. Talk about first world
problems.
