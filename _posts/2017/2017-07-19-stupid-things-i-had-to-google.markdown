"Never memorize something that you can look up." --- Albert Einstein. Some
stupid things I never memorized and had to look up.

- PGP/Keybase usage. Every. Single. Time.
- Timestamp formats every time I need one (\*nix `date`, PHP's `date()`,
  Ruby's `Time#strftime`).
- Rails `has_one` vs `belongs_to` to see which gets the ID.
- Rails `has_and_belongs_to_many` almost every time.
- Ruby's `Hash.new` block syntax. And in almost every case I've tried using it
  the code was changed before shipping and it was removed.
- CSS rules with 3 values, eg `padding: 10px 5px 20px`.
- The argument order for PHP functions like `join()`, `explode()`,
  `array_key_exists()`.
- Weather [sic :trollface:] I should use "its" or "it's" in a sentence.
- The argument order for Ruby's `Enumerable#inject`.
- Documentation links for API vendors that make it impossible to find from
  their own sites.
- The arguments I want for `rsync`.
