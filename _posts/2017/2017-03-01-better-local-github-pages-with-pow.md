A [couple years ago][Building GitHub Pages Locally] I covered how I setup a
local [GitHub Pages][] build environment using [Pow][] with [Rack][]. Things
broke on me recently, and while trying to fix them, I found an even easier
way.

In my original post, I outlined usage of Rack to configure Pow to serve the
static files generated by [Jekyll][]. It turns out this isn't really needed
--- Pow ships with support for [serving static files][Serving Static Files with Pow],
eliminating _most_ of what the Rack approach offers.

_Most?_ What's missing? So far, the only thing I've noticed that doesn't work
is 404 pages. I don't really need these in development, just being able to
open `404.html` in a browser to work on the page itself is enough.

What does my setup look like now?

The project's `Gemfile`:

```
source "https://rubygems.org"

gem "github-pages"
```

Pow setup --- the key here is manually creating the directory under `~/.pow`
the symlinking a `public` directory to the `_site` directory that Jekyll
creates:

```
mkdir -p ~/.pow/myblog ~/work/myblog/_site
ln -s ~/work/myblog/_site ~/.pow/myblog/public
```

Build the blog:

```
jekyll build
```

And open in your browser:

```
open http://myblog.dev/
```
