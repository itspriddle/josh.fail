Christmas was an absolute blast, as it is every year.

I'm typing this from one of my favorite presents my parents got me, my new Das
Keyboard.

As always, I watched A Christmas Story about 6 or 7 times. That movie is
simply one of the best Christmas movies of all time. At work on Christmas Eve,
we watched Home Alone 1 and 2 as well as Dutch to keep in the holiday spirit.
Xmas movies pwn!

Although I would give anything to be a little kid with the rest of the week
off - I have a new friend to keep me company at work.

Until next time...
