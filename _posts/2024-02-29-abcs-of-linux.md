I was browsing through old gists and found an old one with the [ABCs of
Linux][1]

> A is for awk, which runs like a snail, and
> B is for biff, which reads all your mail.
> C is for cc, as hackers recall, while
> D is for dd, the command that does all.
> E is for emacs, which rebinds your keys, and
> F is for fsck, which rebuilds your trees.
> G is for grep, a clever detective, while
> H is for halt, which may seem defective.
> I is for indent, which rarely amuses, and
> J is for join, which nobody uses.
> K is for kill, which makes you the boss, while
> L is for lex, which is missing from DOS.
> M is for more, from which less was begot, and
> N is for nice, which it really is not.
> O is for od, which prints out things nice, while
> P is for passwd, which reads in strings twice.
> Q is for quota, a Berkeley-type fable, and
> R is for ranlib, for sorting ar table.
> S is for spell, which attempts to belittle, while
> T is for true, which does very little.
> U is for uniq, which is used after sort, and
> V is for vi, which is hard to abort.
> W is for whoami, which tells you your name, while
> X is, well, X, of dubious fame.
> Y is for yes, which makes an impression, and
> Z is for zcat, which handles compression.
