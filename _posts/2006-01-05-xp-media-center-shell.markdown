title: XP Media Center Shell
---

Tony sent me a link the other day with the shell for XP Media Center.

Install the exe, right click on your desktop and select 'Properties'...  Click
'Appearance'...  There will be two options that say 'Windows XP Style'...  One
will have an entry called 'Royal'.

Download <a title="XPEnergyBlue2.exe"
