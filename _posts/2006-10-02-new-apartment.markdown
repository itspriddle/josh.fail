title: New Apartment
---

Eric and I finished moving (mostly) everything into our new apartment
yesterday.

I have to say - its fucking awesome. I am just a little nervous, but I guess
its normal. I'll definitely have enough money to live comfortably, its just
going to involve me actually _budgeting_ my money...

Hah! Like - not drinking $8 worth of Red Bull in a day. Or wasting $20 bucks
on the 99 or Cusatos (although, those fucking fried raviolis from Cusatos KICK
ASS!!!).

Our rooms are more or less setup - but we have TONS of boxes still in our
living room. In fact, calling it a 'living room' is laughable in itself...
there isn't room for shit right now, or space to live.

Well - Viatalk in the AM (with a new deliciously shorter drive), followed by
unpacking in the PM for probably the next week. More updates later.
