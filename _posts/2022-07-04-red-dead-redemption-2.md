I'm finally getting around to playing RDR2. It's been fun to see past posts
where I managed to blog my game experiences (Resident Evil 4 - [1][RE4 1],
[2][RE4 2], [3][RE4 3], [4][RE4 4], [5][RE4 5]; The Legend of Zelda: Twilight
Princess - [1][TP 1], [2][TP 2], [3][TP 3], [4][TP 4]). Maybe I can do the
same for this one?

- OMG, I can't believe I missed the watch on the pause screen. I equipped one
  and thought that was the only way to know the time in-game.
- Shot a hotel clerk in the face on accident ðŸ˜‚.
- Asked a friend for a spoiler free explanation on the Bounty system. I
  basically guessed what it was as I was typing it out. He answered me...
  about 2 mins after I wandered into a Post Office and figured the answer out
  in-game.

- Spent the day at work looking forward to playing more. I think I'm starting
  to get sucked in.
- The open-world-ness is so tough in the beginning. I'm never sure what
  exactly I'm supposed to be doing...
- I'm now referring to O'Driscolls as O'Doyles.
- Why do I keep losing so many hats?!

- These horse controls are impossible! Here's [a guide][PS4 Controls].

- Well, I remembered [getting new games sucks today][New Games Today].
- The first hour was fun. I think I killed someone on accident.
