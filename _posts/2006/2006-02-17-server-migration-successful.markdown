I've successfully moved everything from my old server to my new bad ass Host
Rocket server.

ViaTalk has been most excellent this week. A little boring at first, but I'm
starting to catch on and think I'll really enjoy it there.

I'm going to bed... I really just wanted to make sure this all worked
correctly still.
