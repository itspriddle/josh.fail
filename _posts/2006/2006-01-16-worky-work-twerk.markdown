Firstly, I'd like to say that 7:45a is way too early to be alive. Life really
shouldn't begin before noon.

That being said, you should be very excited to note that I'm at Ticketmaster
(Priddleman finally got a job).

Should that invigorate your fancy, you'll also get off on knowing I'm more
than likely bored as fuck; and my pen is likely jabbing its way to my brain
through the ear. Yeah, I warned you I shouldn't be awake at this hour.

@ Ticketmaster until 5.
