title: ITT Tomorrow

Ughhh, gotta go back to ITT tomorrow. Hopefully it isn't snowing or icy
because I'll never make it.

Haha, on the plus side, they have such a horrible problem with after-holiday
attendance that they're running a raffle to get us to show up.

Good times, I'm off to finish up Inglenook Realty (finally).
