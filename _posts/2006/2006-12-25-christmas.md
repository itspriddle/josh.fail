title: Christmas
---

Christmas was pretty cool this year.

My parents got a new German shepherd puppy --- he's awesome, but my
hands/wrists/arms are covered in marks from those sharp little teeth. He's a
smart little bastard --- he opened a gift my mom gave him all by himself.

It was actually cool --- just to be there with everyone in the house.Â For a
few hours, it was like the old days.

And of course, **A Christmas Story** is the best movie ever. I watch it on and
off like 9 times every year.

Good times, indeed.
