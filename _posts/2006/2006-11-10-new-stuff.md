[IT216][1] (Perl) and [IT313][2] (JavaScript) are just about finished.
Nothing all that exciting really...

Voipcowboy is hopeless at the moment. I have, however, started toying with
Asterisk as of late, and it is good times indeed.

Its actually been a while since I've updated this - I've since moved into my
first apartment. I've also finished another project called Movierack, but for
certain reasons, I'm not posting the link.

That's all for now, but I'll be updating soon.
