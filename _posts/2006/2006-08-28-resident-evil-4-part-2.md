title: Resident Evil 4 (part 2)

AHHHH!!!!!

It's really pissing me off now! I just rescued the President's daughter, and
now I have to drag her dumb ass around and make sure she doesn't die. In case
you haven't heard, I hate keep alive missions more than anything. She hasn't
made things difficult yet, but I'm sure she will soon.

Currently, I'm holed up in a shack in the middle of town with the entire
village trying to kill me. At least I don't have to worry about the girl's HP
during all of this, but there's always time.

Addicting indeed --- but starting to get harder...
