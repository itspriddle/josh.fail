title: MxO One More Time
---

So me and Mr. Iversen recently started playing the Matrix Online again. There
have been a couple new combat revisions that have made the game much more
enjoyable than it was in the past.

We've also joined a faction (aka guild, aka cult) of 14 year olds. Haha...
nothing against them, but their maturity level definitely leaves something to
be desired. So that means we'll have to start up our own group, which also
means I'll have to create us a nasty website. Good times.

Buy the Matrix Online now!!!
