I had two glorious days off in a row from VT. I freaking love the place - but
damn, is it good to get 2 days off.

So what did I do? Well, for starters, I added a few tweaks to Inglenook
Realty. Haha, actually, other than that, I didn't do much.

I did pull every key out from my keyboard and soak them in alcohol and cleaned
them all off. Its like having a new one.

Did I mention I wasted $100 bucks on an alternator?Â  I'm pretty sure I did...
