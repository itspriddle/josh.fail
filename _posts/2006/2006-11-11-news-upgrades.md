title: News Upgrades
---

I've recently upgraded the news module on this site to use Wordpress RSS
feeds.

You don't really care, I just want to see a few more content boxes on the
site...

Wordpress is great - with very little effort I was able to take the simple
(non-valid) XML feed I had used for news and import it into this DB.
Brilliant. Time for sleep - for real this time.
