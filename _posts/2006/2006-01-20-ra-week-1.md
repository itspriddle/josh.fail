title: "RA: Week 1"
---

First, I should mention I'm not actually working for Ticketmaster, although I
am working in the same call center (and will eventually be working for TM).
I'm selling camping reservations at a low low price instead.

The first 3 days were really lame. The 4th day wasn't great, but somehow I'd
gotten into the swing and it just didn't completely suck.

So, we spent the majority of the week learning how to do shit on their
computers. "This is how we cancel a reservation," and then we'd make 5
reservations and cancel them all. We got to do "Scenarios." They're
_supposed_ to have complete information so you can properly make the
reservation. Most of them were missing half of the data... it was pretty
lame.

Today we did "mock calls" with the others in the class. Pretty easy cake ass
shit.

Blahh blaahhhh, fockin blaahh.

Everyone should call Reserve America and hang up until you get me. I'll
probably be bored out of my mind...
