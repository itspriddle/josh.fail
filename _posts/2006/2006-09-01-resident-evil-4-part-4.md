title: Resident Evil 4 (part 4)

Have I mentioned this game is like crack?Â  It is...

They do a brilliant job of making it just hard enough so you get your ass beat
--- but not so hard you smash the controller. Maybe I've already said that, I
don't know.

At any rate, I'm like 13 hours through and still on the first disc. This shit
was totally worth $19.
