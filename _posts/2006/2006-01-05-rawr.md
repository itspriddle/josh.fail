Yeah, you can tell I'm bored.

Finishing up Inglenook as we speak. Tony and I have the meeting with them on
Saturday morning. I can't wait to finally be done with this shit.

Also I have to finish this stupid Ticket Master app. This shit is like
homework I swear.

I'm so bored in fact, I'm watching _Down to Earth_. It pretty much sucks, but
oh well. Gotta watch something until Adult Swim starts.
