I'm finally going on vacation!

Well, I leave on Friday... but I am quite excited for a week long break from
both ITT and work. That's certainly not to say I don't enjoy work... I
**hate*** ITT, but I actually enjoy work. But for 10ish days, I'm going to
enjoy not working. Good times.

Don't let it fool you, if everything goes as planned I'll be working on some
web projects quite a bit while I'm away. Who knows if it'll actually happen
though.

Until next time...
