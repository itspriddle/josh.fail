title: A (not) very exciting new jobber
---

Ahh yes, I get to start training at Ticketmaster on Monday. I'm glad to have a
job, but it sounds like the dumbest shit on earth. I know that I'm going to be
bored of it within a month and want to quit.

Whooo, there's quality assurance though, so I could always be fired. That's
something to look forward to.

On another note, [Inglenook Realty](http://www.inglenookrealtyinc.com) is
finally finished. I meet with them tomorrow for a few last minute changes, and
finally get to sign off on it (and get $$$).

That's about it for now...I'm watching some cartoon with a large robot who
goes nuts in the end and destroys everyone. It's great.
