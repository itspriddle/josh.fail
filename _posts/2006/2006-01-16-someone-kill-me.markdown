title: Someone kill me
---

Yeah, so I'm sitting here in the parking lot at Ticketmaster (special thanks
to whoever has the really weak wireless connection around here).

This shit is so gay.  Its an old school building, and we're doing shit that
grade schooler's would be bored with.  Crossword puzzles and interviewing
partners.

Gay ass shit.

Also, I just drove to the bank to cash a check, someone forgot about Martin
Luther King day.  Yeah, I wanted to die too...

Well, my lunch is almost over.  Time for a ciggy and another 5 hours of hell.

Put that track on repeat for 7 days.
