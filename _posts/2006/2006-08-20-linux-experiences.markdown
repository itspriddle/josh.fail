If you've been reading this over the last 8 months or so, you know that I've
gone through somewhat of a love/hate relationship with Linux. I installed
Fedora Core 4 at first and liked it for about a day. As soon as I went to play
an MP3 and realized I couldn't, I was quickly back to Windows.

I probably went a week and decided I'd given up too easily and I should at
least try a dual boot. That was nice for a day, and then I was back in Windows
and consistently skipping Fedora every time I saw grub.

Needless to say, during my first month or so, I spent quite a bit of time
formatting and installing OS's. I did get the idea to setup a file server on
my old HP. CLI was good.

It was the best of both worlds for a while. I had everything important on a
stable server and used my Windows box for everything else. And this was good
for a bit, but then using PuTTY at work (and constantly having it time out)
made me wish for Linux with the built in terminal.

Yes - the gnome-terminal is what compelled me to install Ubuntu on my laptop.
It was scary at first; every time I went to do the easiest task I found a huge
wall (usually of dependencies) in front of me. Thankfully, Ubuntu's forums are
pretty good, and I found answers to all of my questions. I've been using
Ubuntu pretty much exclusively on my laptop for about 3 months. I even find
myself typing `:wq` in notepad when I use Windows.

Good times.  Learn Linux because Linux is great.
