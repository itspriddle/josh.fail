My first week at ViaTalk was awesome.

HostRocket is the coolest company I've ever worked for. They really seem to
care about their employees.

Everyone in the office has been especially friendly and helpful; I really
wasn't expecting that. I guess I'd been jaded by the slew of crappy "out for
yourself only" jobs as of late, but it really was a pleasant surprise.

Believe it or not... I've actually been enjoying myself at work. That's a
first...
