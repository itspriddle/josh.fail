title: "Live Calls: Day 1"

LMFAO, I couldn't have planned it better than this:

My first live call is some old guy who wanted a certain campsite at whatever
campground. They were booked for the entire summer. "Oh I've been camping
there for 32 years. There's no way they're all booked, you guys need to get
your shit together up there."

Haha, I almost laughed right then. Unfortunately I'm not allowed to bite back
as I'd like to (and trust me, if I had my morning RedBull and just that right
amount of sass, I'd make him feel like a retard). He hung up on me before I
could respond.

The rest of the day went pretty smoothly. I dunno, I find it rather boring
to be honest.

The more time I spend working **not** as a coder/designer, the more I realize
I hate everything **but** coding. I told Senior Anthony "I can't wait for
those 96 hour days behind Dreamweaver."

Yeah, I'm a fockin geek. So what? Wanna fight about it?
