Holy shit, some stupid ass punks decided to totally destroy Sweet Home Alabama
on the Jeff Foxworthy Roast...  That really pisses me off.

People who really suck at life shouldn't take good music and destroy it...  It
was almost as bad as Ashlee Simpson at the Rose Bowl (or some fuckin' football
bowl there..)
