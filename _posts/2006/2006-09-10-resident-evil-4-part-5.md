title: Resident Evil 4 (part 5)
---

I beat this game the other day --- and I have to say, overall it was
excellent.

I was a little disappointed in how easy the last boss was, but it's definitely
got replay value.

Once I move into my apartment on the 29th, I'm sure I'll be giving it another
go.

_eagerly awaiting the new Zelda_
