Yeah, so I'm sitting here in the parking lot at Ticketmaster (special thanks
to whoever has the really weak wireless connection around here).

This shit is so dumb. It's an old school building, and we're doing shit that
grade schoolers would be bored with. Crossword puzzles and interviewing
partners.

Dumb ass shit.

Also, I just drove to the bank to cash a check, someone forgot about Martin
Luther King day. Yeah, I wanted to die too...

Well, my lunch is almost over. Time for a ciggy and another 5 hours of hell.

Put that track on repeat for 7 days.
