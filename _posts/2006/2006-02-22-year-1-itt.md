title: "Year 1: ITT"

Wow, I just realized that I've finished my first year at ITT tonight. It
certainly flew by...

No more Linux, I'm so torn up inside. I'll just have to continue using it at
home for no real reason.

I got a 94 in Linux though, and a 90 on the final. Imagine if I had studied...
Hah, the other people in my class hated me enough. If they knew I never
studied I'd be blood in the water.

Off to work on stuff for IT201.
