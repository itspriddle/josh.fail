Just sitting here at ViaTalk bored off of my ass.

On the one hand, its great that no one is having any problems right now. On
the other hand, its absolutely fucking boring. I'd rather be on the phone not
answering people's questions.

Yes, so I have an hour and a half left on my shift, and I really want to kill
myself now. No one has called in about an hour now. I could do web tickets,
but why bother? Prolly don't know the answers to any of the questions
anyway...

Yes, so working until midnight definately sucks. I'm ready to pass out, and
I'm _more_ than adequately rested. Too long staring at the computer screen.
Can't wait to go home and do it all over again...
