title: It's been a while...

It's been a while since I've had the time to update this.

Jan was a pretty crazy month. I landed one job, and then on the second day I
was called back for another (better) one.

I start at ViaTalk on Monday. I'm really not looking forward to waking up at
6:30 and being ready to drive at 7:00. Rolling out of bed at quarter to 8 is
hard enough, how the hell am I going to do it 2 hours earlier? I just keep
telling myself I'll live, and the money will definitely be worth it...

In other exciting news, I've recently moved all of my MP3's, videos, program
installs, and such to a Samba share on a Linux box. I highly suggest this for
everyone. Too many times spyware or a virus has caused me to have to pick and
choose what I'm going to save. No worries on Linux. No one touches the box,
and I'll never be in that situation again.

Time for bed, I've got work tomorrow at 9. Only two more days at Reserve
America!
