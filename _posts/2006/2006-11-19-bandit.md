My poor dog, is not doing very well... He hasn't eaten in 5 days and he's
literally starving himself to death. My sister and I went by to see him today,
and it was one of the saddest days of my life.

I remember 15 years ago getting him from the pound for my dad.  We gave him a
bowl of milk for his first meal because my mom had forgotten food. Most
animals are a little nervous around new people, but he ate it right up and
then literally picked the bowl up and brought it to us for more. That was an
awesome day - me, my sister and all of our friends running around the front
yard with the new puppy.

My dad used to come home, and he would run back and forth through the house
for 20 minutes. Today, he fell after getting a drink and I nearly started
sobbing like a baby. Haha, I remember also chasing him almost a mile away one
night in the snow. I was so scared alone in the woods looking for him.

He used to be so full of life, but now... uhhh...  It just fucking sucks.

I know, hes old, but I've known that dog most of my life. Seeing him like that
really got to me. I wish there was something that I could do, but
unfortunately a dog's life is finite. I really didn't think it would get to me
this badly.

Bandit my friend, we will never forget you.
