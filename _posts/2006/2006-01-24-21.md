Indeed, I am 21 today.  Wasn't very fun, and I don't drink.  Hoorah!!

On another note, I have an interview tomorrow for what could quite possibly be
a better job than the one I currently have.

The job, as I understand it, will be more or less identical to RA. The
difference though, is that its in an IT environment.

The gentleman I spoke with seemed rather interested. I'd much rather have that
job.
