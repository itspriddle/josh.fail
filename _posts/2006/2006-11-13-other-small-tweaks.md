title: Other Small Tweaks
---

I have just added several new RSS feeds to make editing this site easier for
me. This will [hopefully] mean that I'll be able to update this site more
frequently, but we shall see...

Anyhoo - I have added modules for Recent Portfolio projects. Also, I plan to
add functionality for individual portfolio entries over the next few days.

All of this - should hopefully be a prelude for a new CSS file... but again,
we shall see...
