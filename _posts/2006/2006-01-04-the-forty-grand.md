title: The Forty Grand

It's always great to be so bored at ITT that I **have** to leave early. Every
time I'm there I'm just a bit further in debt, and every time I feel as though
it's all been a complete waste of money.

All for that stupid fuckin diploma. It had better be diamond encrusted and
come with a really nice frame. Forty thousand dollars.

They don't even turn the freakin heat on most of the time.

Yeah... it's a pain in the ass, back again tomorrow for Mr. Cheer and his eggs
and ducks.
