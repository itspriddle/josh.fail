Haven't had much time lately to do anything with this or any of my other
sites. Although, I can't lie, when I had the time I never did anything with
it. I'm just lazy when it comes to my own work I guess.

I've been working 6 days a week and then going to school until 10:30 three of
those nights. The math teacher is insane... they all are if you think about
it. If you show up 10 minutes late he feels he needs to remind you that you're
paying to be late. Thanks pal, as if I didn't already comprehend the
incredible waste of money your class is to me, I get you throwing it in my
face on a weekly basis.

I got Mr Iversen a jobber at the Viatalk kiosk at Crossgates. Stop in and buy
some VOIP why don'tcha?

Also, I need to get an apartment within the next 3 or 4 months. So, if I know
you and I don't hate you, give me a call some time. I definately cant afford
one on my own...
