title: Moving on Friday
---

Yes - Eric and I move into our apartment on Friday. Unfortunately - the
carpeters aren't coming until Saturday, so we're camping out in the living
room until then. We are, however, having our cable installed tomorrow, so I'll
have the void of the 'net to keep me company the entire time.

Good times indeed.
