title: Resident Evil 4

This game kicks ass.

From what I've played so far, its very similar to Resident Evil 2 in its 'up
in your face' action style. Within the first 5 minutes of turning it on you've
got 10 people trying to kill you.

It was a little difficult to figure out the controls since I bought a used
copy that didn't include an instruction manual (the new ones have long since
been sold). I'm getting better, and so is this game with each passing hour.

Hey, if my cousin lost his job over it, it has to be a good game.

I'll continue to update this as I play (if I can pull myself away long enough
that is).
