I stumbled on a list of [rarely used HTML attributes][1] today. Two stuck out:

1. `enterkeyhint` to swap the enter key on a form field from "Go" to "Next",
    etc. I knew certain keyboard types, like email, could change the text on
    this field, but I didn't know there were more options. You can't just put
    in text willy-nilly, so do check out the docs on the options.
2. `form` on form fields allows a field to be placed outside of a `<form>`
    tag. I haven't needed this often, but when I have, it was always a pain.

The others are less useful, but still good to know about.
