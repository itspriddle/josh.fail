Stewie is my hero.

Nip/Tuck was crazy last night. I'm not going to get into it other than to say
I'm disappointed by their decisions, but I'm definitely eagerly awaiting the
start of Season 4.

My sister officially left yesterday. LMFAO then my dad had the nerve to try
and guilt trip me as though I didn't do my part to keep her here.

YOU are the one who made her leave. Not her, not Mike, not me. You drove her
crazy, and I don't blame her at all for what she's done.

On a lighter note, I started playing Prince of Persia: Sands of Time again
yesterday. That game seriously kicks ass.

I'm off to format my Linux box. In my dad's infinite wisdom, he's decided not
to let my sister have her computer. So my crimbo gift to you is a semi-used
computer all set for you to download viruses to.
