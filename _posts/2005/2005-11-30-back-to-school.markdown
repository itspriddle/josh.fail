That week was excellent... so now it's back to ITT. Actually, I started back
yesterday.

So I walk into IT201 (Web Site Design) and no one is around. Class starts 20
minutes late. Then, to top it off, we're learning Photoshop CS and Flash MX
2004.

That would have been great a year ago. I would have been happy in fact. But
these programs are both a year old, and both have been updated. I just think
its pretty stupid to learn shit that is already obsolete. I have CS2 on my
laptop, and just doing the 1st lab there are a number of differences between
the two programs. To boot, the prof has the weirdest sideburns you've ever
seen...

Today I get to enjoy IT250 (Linux Operating System), which I'm actually kind
of excited for. Hopefully the teacher isn't lame. Hopefully I'll be able to
ditch lab 1.5 hours early.

ITT sure is swell!
