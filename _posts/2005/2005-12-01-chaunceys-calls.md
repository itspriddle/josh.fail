Chauncey's Calls

So I walk in at 1:00am after a very exciting Linux class and the craziest
teacher ever. I had set my phone on silent at school, and left it in my laptop
case. I pull it from my bag to find 17 missed calls.

Seventeen missed calls? That's fucking impossible. But it wasn't.

Mr. Noodle's must have really been bored, as he found the time to call me 17
times in less than 2 hours. 

I could have let this go, but that's an average of one call every 7 minutes.
Had I actually had my phone on me, I might have been quite annoyed. If I had
been in class during this outburst, someone would have to pay.

I don't mean to rant, but SEVENTEEN FUCKING TIMES! 

Anyhow, here is the list of missed calls from the time I left school.
