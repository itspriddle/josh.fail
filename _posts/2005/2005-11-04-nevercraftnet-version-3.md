After messing around with this layout for over a year, I've recreated it yet
again in cross browser XHTML.

At least it looks right in the current top 3 browsers (IE6, Firefox1, and
Opera7).

Don't cry if you have an old browser that doesn't render this properly.
Well... if your computer sucks so much you have an old browser you probably
should cry...
