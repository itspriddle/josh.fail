title: I hate snow
---

Well it's going to snow here tonight. Beautiful, just fucking beautiful. It's
not even Thanksgiving yet and I'm going to have to shovel.

Okay, so I probably won't have to shovel the 2-4 inches we're going to get. I
can bitch though. There shouldn't be any snow until winter hits on December
22.

GRR!!!!

It's too cold too.

I like to bitch a lot. You apparently like to listen.
