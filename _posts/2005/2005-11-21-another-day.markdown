For some strange reason I didn't sleep...

And now I'm wide awake, although the eyes do burn.

I'm watching Krypto the Superdog, only because I can't find the remote to
change the channel. I like to leave it on Cartoon Network all night, and
sometime around 6am Adult Swim turns into the current brand of children's
cartoons.

Wow. The innuendo of these cartoons is horrible. Anyone else remember Ren &
Stimpy with the Log? Now that I think about it, Ren & Stimpy was really
bad.. I mean BAD.

I'd never let my kids watch it.

So I'm sitting here trying to work on Inglenook Realty. I'm really sick of
this site. I just want graphics in my lap and 2 days to go nuts with PHP. It
won't happen for weeks, but oh well.

I'm going to try working on it... perhaps its time for some Alice in Chains?
