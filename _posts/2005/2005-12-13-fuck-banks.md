I really hate banks... The stupidest little shit happens and then they charge
you $70 fucking bucks.

Fuck you.

Tales of Symphonia is deliciously addicting. Not quite as much as Nip / Tuck,
but none the less excellent.

I've been playing since 2am. I took like an hour break, but it's still been a
long time.
