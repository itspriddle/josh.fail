Somehow I slept all day. Probably because I was up all night, and half of the
morning... I really need to get a job because the boredom is killing me.

The Goonies is on though. I'm almost ashamed to admit it, but I'm 20 and I've
never seen it the entire way through. So I'm going to sit here and watch it.

It better be good dammit...
