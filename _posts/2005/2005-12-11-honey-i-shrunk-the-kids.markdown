title: Honey I Shrunk The Kids
---

I don't care who you are, "Honey I Shrunk the Kids" is one of the best movies
of the 80s.

For 1989, the effects in that movie are superb. Not only that, but the plot
was genuinely catchy. Those kids are outside in the back yard for 2 days. They
almost die like every 10 minutes!
