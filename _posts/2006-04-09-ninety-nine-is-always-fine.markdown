title: Ninety-nine is always fine
---

There really was some kick ass music at the end of the 90s. Snot of course,
but currently I'm re-addicted to Staind's first CD Dysfunction. Mike Mushok
kicks major ass. And the singer doesn't suck too much on this CD... its a great
time.

For some stupid reason I brought my server to Tony's and thought I could get
it back in a timely fashion. I didn't, and all my files are on it. I want to
fool around with Asterisk and I cant... bastard.

I'm sure I have math homework to do. My poor monitor had to get pushed off, I
have to pay some taxes and register my car this week. Don't worry my sweet, I
shall purchase you soon.
