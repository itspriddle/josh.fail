[Universal Control][1] on macOS is awesome!

I found out on accident that it basically duplicates [Synergy][2] with Macs. I
had my iMac running along side my MacBook Air for the first time in a while
and noticed I could drag the cursor from one machine to another.

I'm running an old Mac mini with my laptop on two Studio Displays right now
while I wait for a new M2 Pro mini to ship and it works flawlessly.

My wife was nice enough to indulge me in nerding out over how awesome this
is---in my defense, this stuff used to be a pain in the ass to setup!

Anyway, a neat feature and the first time macOS has made me smile in a _long_
time.
