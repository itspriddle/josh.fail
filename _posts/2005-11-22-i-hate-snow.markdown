title: I hate snow
---

Well its going to snow here tonight.  Beautiful, just fucking beautiful.  Its
not even Thanksgiving yet and I'm going to have to shovel.

Okay, so I probably won't have to shovel the 2-4 inches we're going to get.  I
can bitch though.  There shouldn't be any snow until winter hits on December
22.

GRR!!!!

Its too cold too.

I like to bitch a lot.  You apparently like to listen.
