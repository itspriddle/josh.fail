I stumbled across [this quote on Hacker News][Post] that talks about what it
feels like to be a good programmer:

> Nobody tells this to people who are beginners, I wish someone told me. All
> of us who do creative work, we get into it because we have good taste. But
> there is this gap. For the first couple years you make stuff, it's just not
