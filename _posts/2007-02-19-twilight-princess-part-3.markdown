And 13.5 hours later...

This game is crack. That's all there is to it. You think I'm kidding with the
13.5 hours? There _may_ be 30 mins worth of bathroom and CVS breaks in
there, but other than that, my eyes have bled since about 3 hours in.

Every time I come to this site, I have every intention on taking a 10 minute
break and actually writing something about the game; but every time, I listen
to the music in the background as I type a few sentences, and I'm compelled to
pick the controller up and see what's next.

Until next time... [I will be breaking long enough tomorrow to get my tires
changed...]
