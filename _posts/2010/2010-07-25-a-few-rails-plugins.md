I extracted a few pieces of code into Rails Plugins.

* [Cars](http://github.com/itspriddle/cars): Helpers for populating dropdowns with automobile makes and models
* [Host Router](http://github.com/itspriddle/host_router): Allows creation of routes based on hostname or port
* [Multisite](http://github.com/itspriddle/multisite): Provides site-specific view paths
* [Remote Database](http://github.com/itspriddle/remote_database): Helpers for working with databases on multiple hosts
* [Fraud Guardian](http://github.com/itspriddle/fraud_guardian): Helpers for generating fraud reports via FraudGuardian

Nothing spectacular, but maybe they'll help someone else.
