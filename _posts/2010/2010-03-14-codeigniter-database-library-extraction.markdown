title: CodeIgniter Database Library Extraction
---

I've used [CodeIgniter](http://codeigniter.com/) in several PHP projects, and
I love it (if I _have_ to write PHP). I'm a big fan of the included
[Database Library](http://codeigniter.com/user_guide/database/index.html).

I write a lot of server side scripts in PHP for work (crons, etc). I really
hate [ADODB](http://adodb.sourceforge.net/)'s syntax, so I set out to extract
CodeIgniter's database library.

[CodeIgniter Database Library](http://github.com/itspriddle/codeigniter-database-library/)
is the result of my hacking. I haven't tested this very thoroughly, but I plan
to with any PHP scripts I write in the future.
