After putting it off for too long, I've redesigned my blog using
[Jekyll](http://github.com/mojombo/jekyll) and
[GitHub Pages](http://pages.github.com). It ended up being a lot easier than
I thought, and Jekyll can do some pretty sweet stuff.

Soon, I'll be posting the steps I took to make a simple search box for my
posts. Stay tuned.
