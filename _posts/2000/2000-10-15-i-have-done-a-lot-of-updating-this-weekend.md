I have done a lot of updating this weekend. I've uploaded some Snot tunes. I
don't really know which ones are up yet and which ones aren't because I
stopped halfway between the upload and forgot to check. I've done some editing
to the chicks section. A bunch of Catherine Zeta-Jones thumbs to make. I
watched Entrapment today. Very good movie. I've gotten basically everything I
need in order as far as CSS and layouts are concerned. I don't know how long
it will be until I have everything up. Soon I hope. I've got like 8 people I
want to put in the chicks section. It took me about a week to do all the
thumbs and what not for Heidi Klum. I hope this doesn't take as long. 8 weeks
is a long time. I've been thinking about a new version for my site because its
been so long since I made this one. Bored with it already... Well, go download
some Snot. I command you. Click on music then real media. And have fun! Oh,
and as long as I'm here typing, if anyone knows a guest book like gbook.nu
that uses their own server, ie. I don't need cgi access to use it, please let
me know.
