title: "Six Months at Site5"

I can't believe it's already been six months since I joined the engineering 
crew at Site5. I've been having a blast!

Looking at my 
[GitHub profile](https://github.com/itspriddle), it's pretty obvious to me how
much I've grown these past 6 months. I've developed and released three
rubygems used in other Site5 projects 
([hamburglar](https://github.com/site5/hamburglar), 
[snuggie](https://github.com/site5/snuggie), and 
[fanny_pack](https://github.com/site5/fanny_pack)). I've helped the
original developers of a few other Site5 gems
([solusvm](https://github.com/site5/solusvm),
[moo_moo](https://github.com/site5/moo_moo),
[lumberg](https://github.com/site5/lumberg), and 
[squall](https://github.com/site5/squall)). I've helped with some proprietary
projects. I'm also happy to say I'm helping with one engineer's transition from 
PHP to Ruby :)

Along the way I've learned the value of BDD and tests in projects. I've had a
chance to play with Node.js and coffeescript on our company sponsored hackdays. 
I've finally had a chance to get to know Rails 3. In fact, I'm co-developing
one of Site5's first Rails 3 projects, which will likely turn out to be one of
it's largest applications. **I live for this stuff**, so this has been awesome
fun for me.

The first day I started working for Site5, I decided to switch my editor to 
MacVim from Textmate. I'd been playing with MacVim on and off for a few
months, but something always brought me back to TextMate. After six months
with MacVim, I can say it's one of the best decisions I've made as far as my
development environment goes. I won't get into all the details in this post,
but I'll note that I'm much faster with writing and editing code than I ever
was in TextMate.

Aside from the actual code and tools, working with a team of engineers using 
the same tools and languages as me been an amazing experience. Being able to
bounce ideas off of someone else is invaluable.

I'm learning a ton of new things all the time, and constantly able to practice 
and perfect the things I use daily. I decided to join Site5 because I thought
it would be a great environment to learn and build great software - if this is
what the first six months has been like, I can't wait to see what the next
year or two will bring.
