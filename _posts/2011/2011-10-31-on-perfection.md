This quote from Bleach sums up my thoughts on perfection pretty well:

> There is no such thing as a perfect being in this world. That may sound
clich√©, but it's the truth. The average person admires perfection and seeks
to obtain, what is the point of achieving perfection? There is none.
Nothing. Not even a single thing. I loathe perfection! If something is
perfect, then there is nothing left. There is no room for imagination, no
creativity. No place left for a person to gain additional knowledge or
abilities. Do you know what that means? For scientists such as ourselves,
perfection only brings despair. It is our job to create things more wonderful
than anything before them, but never obtain perfection. A scientist must be a
person who finds ecstasy while suffering from that antimony, who finds disease
while he has it.
