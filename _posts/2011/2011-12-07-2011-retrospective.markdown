The year is coming to a close, so I thought it would be a good time to reflect
at some of the projects I've worked on in 2011.

  DotBlock's public API.

  gem for communicating with the DotBlock API.

  wrapper for communicating with the DotBlock API.

  utility library for use in Titanium Mobile applications.

  is the first iPhone application for DotBlock.
