title: iDium mod for Adium
---

I've been itching to get a hold of this [Adium](http://adium.im/) mod since
seeing it on [MacThemes](http://macthemes.net) about a year ago. I decided to
check back in the other day, and was pleasantly surprised to see that
[iDium](http://macthemes.net/forum/viewtopic.php?pid=677432#p677432) had
finally been publicly released.
