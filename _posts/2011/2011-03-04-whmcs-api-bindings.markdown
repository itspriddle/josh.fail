title: WHMCS API Bindings
---

I recently extracted some of my DotBlock work to create WHMCS API Bindings
in PHP and Ruby.

At DotBlock we're all big fans of open source software, so we try to give back
to the community whenever we can. We're releasing API wrappers for the popular
[WHMCS][] billing software: one in [Ruby][] and another in [PHP][].

These libraries allow you to get up and running with the [WHMCS API][] in just
a few minutes. If you're a Ruby or PHP developer working with WHMCS, check
them out at [github/dotblock][].
