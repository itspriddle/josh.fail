title: The Internet 2.0
---

From Tony Montana:

> Earlier this afternoon the thought to be indesctructable Internet was
  declared unstable. By 6pm all hopes for the continuation of largest
  collection of data known to mankind were lost. Though, it is too early to
  truely know exactly what happened, researchers and productive internet users
  believe that its collapse was due entirely to the horrific waste of
  bandwith on myspace, blog sites, aol, yahoo, and msn. Fortunately for the
  remaining productive internet users, a team of network technicians have
  open the doors to what they consider its replacement, The Internet 2.
  Edwindbag Monfred and Sir Albertous Gorfus, the creators of the Internet 2,
  have made thousands of adjustments over the past few months, and they feel
  very confident that the ITT Tech Virtual Library (Internet 2) will live up
  to all of our internet needs. If it doesnt work, Edwindbag says, "who cares,
  everyones fucking illiterate anyways."

>  If you encounter Edwindbag please tell him that he needs to stop peaking over the urinal dividers, and i think hes a monkey fucker.
