title: Its been a long time

I know I never update this much. I can't seem to find the time to sit down and
spend 5-10 minutes on this blog - although, I do often waste time writing in
the company blog. Who knows if anyone even reads this?

Well, right now me and Mr. Bryk are playing Final Fantasy VII: Dirge of
Cerberus. Its sick as shit. I'll definitely be picking it up sometime soon.

Also, me and Mr. Iversen will be moving into our first apartment on September
29th. We're going to have crazy shit in there: ethernet in the bedrooms with
sexual wall jacks, MythTV, and a massive amount of electronics. Our electric
bill will be through the roof - but who cares?!?!

I've also been working on
<a title="Voipcowboy" href="http://voipcowboy.net">voipcowboy</a> here and
there. It's nothing much to look at yet, but I promise when I get some
motivation, I'll make something of it.
