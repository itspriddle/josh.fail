I replaced the stock switches and plate in my Keychron Q2.

For the switches, I saw [Holy Panda X's][1] on sale on Drop. This is the first
time I've bought custom switches. I am pretty sure I like them so far. The
springiness is _very_ noticeable. I didn't expect this much of a difference on
the 60g Holy Panda's vs the 55g Gateron G Pro browns that come stock, but it's
night and day.

I also swapped out the stock steel plate for a [polycarbonate one][2].
Apparently it is bouncier? I'm not really sure how much of what I'm feeling is
the plate vs the switches. It's a pain in the ass to swap the plate (every
switch needs to come off), so I'm probably putting it off for a while. I have
a brass and FC4 one to try out someday, too.

Now to play around more with foam and tape mods ðŸ˜€
