title: Oh, how I love you Kate...

The KDE text editor Kate is my latest weapon. Its great if you're on a slower
connection (or you're torrenting and killing a faster one) as it downloads the
file to your hard drive before you edit it. I love me some vim - but it is no
fun on a slow connection, waiting 30 seconds to move between lines.

kio (K input/output) is the most amazing thing ever, namely fish. Its pretty
much like mounting an SSH share, but it seems to be a lot faster. You can
involke it on any server that supports SSH by simply browsing to
fish://username@sever or you can go to a specific directory by adding the
absolute path to the end of the string.

Using Dolpin's split view, you have a file transfer program with a gui,
similar to gFTP for GNOME or CuteFTP/Filezilla for Windows. You can even set
permissions by right clicking the file and choosing properties.

Another tasty KDE morsel that pwns the GNOME...
