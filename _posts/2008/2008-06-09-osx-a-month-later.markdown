title: OSX - A Month Later
---

It took me a while to get used to the quirks, but I have not only gotten used
to OS X, but it is now my favorite operating system.

Surprisingly, its the little things that make this OS so attractive, as well
as drove me insane over the last month. The biggest thing was getting the
home/end and page up/page down keys to work correctly in the Terminal (which I
was finally able to do, and will be posting a quick howto on soon).

For the most part, my little Mac mini is fast as hell. Fireworks CS3 is a
delicious dream under OS X. TextMate is almost certainly the best text editor
I've used. Even CSSEdit, which I thought would be pointless, turned out to be
an awesome program that has helped me quite a bit in my CSS designing.

Sometimes I really miss the Penguin - but apples are delicious indeed.
