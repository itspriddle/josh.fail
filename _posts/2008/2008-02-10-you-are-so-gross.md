Since I can't stand looking at the layout anymore, I've redirected
www.nevercraft.net here.  Not much going on here either, but it's just a bit
less stagnant.

On a side note, I began the database design and coding some core controllers
for the next version.  Believe it or not, I've learned a ton since I last
messed with it, and its about time I devote some of that new knowledge to my
own projects.
