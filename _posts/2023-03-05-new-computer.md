I went üê∑ mode for my latest computer, an M2 Pro Mac mini.

- M2 Pro 10 core CPU / 16 core GPU / 16 core Neural Engine
- 32GB RAM
- 1TB SSD
- 10GB Ethernet
- 4x Thunderbolt 4 ports
- 1x HDMI (which I'll _never_ use)
- 2x USB-A ports
- 2x Apple Studio Display

I'm not yet used to using two screens again, but man is this a great computer!
