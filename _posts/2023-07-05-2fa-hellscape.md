2FA is a necessary evil, but man does it annoy me at least weekly...

\> be me  
\> done with meetings for the day, yay  
\> move to laptop in living room to close out the day  
\> someone wants me to check a ticket  
\> ticket system needs me to authenticate again because it's been a week since laptop was used for work  
\> get redirected to company SSO server  
\> timeout on SSO server because not on the company VPN  
\> VPN needs 2FA  
\> phone is in still in the office, so go grab it  
\> connect to VPN  
\> go back to SSO server page  
\> launch 1Password to fill password  
\> 1Password demands 2FA for work account  
\> fill in credentials for company SSO  
\> redirected back to ticket system  
\> forget entirely what I was doing and get reminded about it the next day
