title: So much work...
---

So little time... of course.

So we've got this project for IT201, which is barely started. Its due on
Tuesday. Today's pretty much the last day to do anything... and I don't even
have the slightest clue where to begin.

Oh well, hopefully I'll pull something out of my ass and we'll get a good
grade.
