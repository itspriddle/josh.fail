title: "Shell Tricks: Better Bash debug"

Toss the following snippet at the top of any Bash script and run with
`DEBUG=1` to automatically activate `set -x` and print its output via `$PS4`.

```
if [ "$DEBUG" ]; then
  export PS4='+ [${BASH_SOURCE##*/}:${LINENO}] '
  set -x
fi
```

From a dirty `ical-week` [script][1] I threw together to calculate the week
number in Calendar.app Reckoningâ„¢, here's the `DEBUG` in action:

```
~ % DEBUG=1 =ical-week
+ [ical-week:36] set -e
+ [ical-week:197] main
+ [ical-week:166] local target_date pad=02 advance
+ [ical-week:168] [[ 0 -gt 0 ]]
++ [ical-week:183] date +%F
+ [ical-week:183] : 2022-02-08
+ [ical-week:185] [[ 2022-02-08 =~ ^[0-9]{4}-[0-9]{2}-[0-9]{2}$ ]]
+ [ical-week:190] [[ -n '' ]]
+ [ical-week:194] week_number 2022-02-08 02
+ [ical-week:129] local now=2022-02-08 pad=02 week offset ord dow year_end_dow year_start_dow
