One of those random Work From Home Things my fianc√©e and I both have: marking
yourself away for lunch must be done on a timestamp ending in `:00`, `:15`,
`:30`, or `:45`. If not, you have to wait for the next one to come around.

I don't know why we are the way that we are. I think I'll marry her.
