It took me a few years to truly _grasp_ MySQL and the concept of relational
databases. The [MySQL Pocket Reference][1] is the book that helped it all
click for me.

I loved how small this was. I literally carried it around in my back pocket to
school and work for a few weeks. I could skim the entire book in one sitting
and it was a great way to drill the concepts in.

My favorite part is that this 15 year old book probably isn't very dated since
SQL has been SQL since the 60s.
