The [LackRack][1] was mentioned on [Hacker News][2] today. tl;dr: a cheap Ikea
table _might_ make a decent little 19" network rack.

More info on [boingboing][3]. Searching reddit, sounds like this is hit or
miss---Ikea's quality on these seems to go up and down randomly.

Still, a cool idea that might be worth messing around with before going all in
on a metal rack.
