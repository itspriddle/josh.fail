One of my coworkers loves to say "Layer 2", "Layer 3", etc. I learned this in
school to pass a test and promptly forgot. There's always a mnemonic, I know I
memorized it once for that test. So I looked it up again so I can maybe stop
feeling dumb on those calls:

- All Pros Search Top Notch Donut Places
- All People Seem To Need Data Processing
- All People Should Try New Dr Pepper
- A Priest Slapped The Nun During Prayer

And a couple OSI layer mnemonics which work from the bottom up:

- Please Do Not Throw Sausage Pizza Away
- Please Do Not Touch Steve's Pet Alligator

And a handy table with the layer number and an example:

| #   | Layer        | Example      |
| --- | ------------ | ------------ |
| 7   | Application  | HTTP         |
| 6   | Presentation | SSL          |
| 5   | Session      | Logical port |
| 4   | Transport    | TCP          |
| 3   | Network      | IP           |
| 2   | Data Link    | MAC          |
| 1   | Physical     | DSL          |

I won't remember any of this, but now I can find it quickly the next time that
coworker tosses "Layer 2" out ðŸ˜€
