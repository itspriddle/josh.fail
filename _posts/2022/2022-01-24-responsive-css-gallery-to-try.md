Searching for image gallery templates, I came across [this one][1] that looks
light-weight and decent enough.

I saw that Jekyll supports adding front-matter to static files[^1] (i.e.
images). A few times I've wanted to throw small image galleries up on GitHub
Pages but the manual work to maintain it always stopped me.

For when I stumble across this later, I also found [more options][2].
