A coworker shared this post from LinkedIn, 11 Promises of a Manager. I try to
follow all of these, mainly because I've been lucky enough that most of _my_
managers followed them too.

> 1. We'll have a weekly 1:1. I'll never cancel this meeting, but you can cancel
> it whenever you like. It's your time.
> 
> 2. Our 1:1 agenda will be in the meeting invite so we remember important
> topics. But you're always free to use the time for whatever's on your mind
> 
> 3. When I schedule a meeting with you, I'll always say *when I schedule it*
> what it's meant to be about. I will not schedule meetings without an agenda.
> 
> 4. When I drop into your DM's, I'll always say "hi and why." No suspense, no
> small talk while you are wondering what I want.
> 
> 5. News or announcements that significantly impact you, your work, or your
> team will come from me directly in a 1:1, not revealed in a big meeting.
> 
> 6. You'll get feedback from me when it's fresh. There will be no feedback in
> your performance review that you're hearing for the first time.
> 
> 7. I trust you to manage your own time. You don't need to clear with me in
> advance your time AFK or 000
> 
> 8. Your work gets done your way. My focus is on outcomes, not output. Once
> we're clear on where we need to go, how to get there is up to you. If I ever
> find it necessary to suggest a specific approach, I will supply an example.
> 
> 9. A team is strongest when it's working together, looking after one another,
> and taking care of each other. Please look to your left and to your right for
> opportunities to help your colleagues. Please ask for help when you need it.
> Nobody works alone.
> 
> 10. I trust you to skip level and talk to my manager or other senior
> management about anything you feel is relevant. You don't need to clear it
> with me, and I'm not going to get weird about it when you do
> 
> 11. I will attribute credit appropriately to you and your team. I will never
> exaggerate my own role or minimize your contribution. I'Il be especially
> certain to nail down attribution when senior management are hearing of our
> accomplishments.
> 
> If all of this sounds good to you, I hope you can reciprocate by giving me the
> one thing I need most: The truth.
> 
> I want to hear your feedback, to know when you think I'm wrong, and your ideas
> for how we can do better.
> 
> I'll always welcome your thoughts, listen patiently, and never respond
> defensively.
> 
> If we trust each other, we can learn and grow together. That's how I want to
> work with you.

If there's only one you follow yourself, fellow manager, pick #4. I'm not sure
I'll ever stop thinking it's bad news when a boss messages me like that...
