title: Server migration successfull
---

I've successfully moved everything from my old server to my new bad ass Host
Rocket server.

ViaTalk has been most excellent this week...  A little boring at first, but
I'm starting to catch on and think I'll really enjoy it there.

I'm going to bed... I really just wanted to make sure this all worked
correctly still.
