As a fully distributed team, Slack is our main tool for real-time
communication with each other. Keeping up with dozens of messages a day can be
daunting, and distractions abound. Here are just a few ways I've seen remote
teams of all sizes use Slack effectively to cut through the noise and keep the
communication flowing.

Also known as the Ten Slack Commandments:

1. Say Hello and Goodbye to your team when you start and end your day.

    We can't see each other arriving or leaving an office. When you arrive to
    start your shift or are heading out, let your team's channel know with a
    quick "Howdy" or "Later all!". It's a small thing, but it really helps
    your team and leads know what your status is and avoids questions like "Is
    Josh in today?".

2. Make sure you check Slack regularly during your shift.

    This one should be obvious – you need to keep up on your messages in
    important channels/DMs during your working hours. Everyone will have times
    they're distracted by meetings or emergencies, but generally, you should
    be able to respond to someone within 5-10 minutes. When you need help,
    you'll want a quick response, too, so you should always try to do the
    same.

3. Use Statuses/DND/Away if you aren't available.

    If you're stepping away from lunch or going to an important meeting where
    Slack is going to be an interruption, throw up a status (🍕Lunch) or
    enable DND. The rest of us can see these and they're a great way to let
    people know you're not available at the moment. If you're away on an
    extended break or not working, mark yourself Away so the rest of us know
    you're gone. Installing the Google Calendar App for Slack will
    automatically throw up a (🗓Meeting) status whenever you have a calendar
    event. One other pro tip: if you're leaving on extended PTO, change your
    display name to something like "Josh Priddle (PTO through Feb 20th)".
    Everyone will see this if they try messaging you and will
    know *immediately* that they shouldn't expect a response (or should email
    you).

4. Respect others' Statuses/DND.

    If someone else has put up a Status indicating they're busy, or enabled
    DND, try to respect that unless it is absolutely unavoidable. If you need
    to let your lead know about an emergency, by all means, interrupt them.
    But, if it is something that can wait, people will appreciate you not
    interrupting their work, or at least letting them know it is not a
    pressing issue and it can wait until they're available.

5. Provide as many details as possible when asking someone for help.

    When you need to DM someone, you're almost certain to be
    interrupting *something* that they're doing. Kicking off with "Hi are you
    busy?" only makes it more difficult for them to help quickly. Instead, in
    your first message, let the person know what you need, any troubleshooting
    steps you might have tried, links to relevant tickets and/or WHMCS pages,
    or what the specific question you have is. Example: "Howdy, _______! I'm
    looking into a VPS provisioning issue for a client - [WHMCS LINK]. I've
    confirmed the WHMCS settings appear to be correct on the VPS service, but
    I'm seeing the following error 'Could not connect to server'. The customer
    has been waiting for a day already, could you take a look soon or point me
    toward someone who can?" The more information you can provide up front the
    better.

6. Use Threads to avoid too much noise in group chats.

    Often your team's Slack channel is the first place you'll report an issue
    or reach out for help. If you are responding to such messages, Slack's
    Threads are a fantastic way to continue the conversation without adding
    additional noise to the main channel. However, do keep in mind that
    Threads can reduce visibility of messages. If you think a message in a
    thread needs to be more visible, you can check the "Also send to
    CHANNELNAME" checkbox when replying to a thread.

7. Prefer group chats over Direct Messages when it makes sense.

    If you're asking a general question or sharing a piece of knowledge that
    might be useful for the rest of your team, it can be a good idea to post
    it in a group chat instead of a DM. Often, there are others on the team
    with the same question as you, or someone you weren't considering Direct
    Messaging has the answer. We want to remain collaborative whenever we can!

8. Avoid Slack for important announcements that people *must* read.

    If you're sharing something important that your entire team needs to know
    about, Slack is **NOT** the place to do it. These should happen in emails
    (you're checking your Inbox throughout the day, right?). Feel free to
    mention it in Slack as well (though try to avoid overuse
    of `@here` or `@channel`, especially in large cross-team channels). Slack
    should **never** be the only place important communications are sent
    though.

9. Know when to move to voice chat.

    Often a question or issue can result in many people trying to share their
    ideas or insights. As mentioned above, threads are a great way to cut down
    on noise in channels. However, sometimes text is difficult or slow to
    really convey your thoughts. If you've spent 10 minutes discussing
    something and don't feel like the conversation is moving, switch to voice
    and talk it out. Bonus points if you provide an update in Slack after
    you've come to an agreement.

10. Text is hard. Always assume the best in people.

    It can be hard to convey ideas, emotion, and tone via text. You might read
    someone else's message and think they're being short or curt with you,
    when in fact, they're buried in work and had to quickly respond. Try to be
    self aware of how you're presenting yourself in Slack, and if you think
    you've come across the wrong way, try to understand why and correct it if
    possible. Reread your messages and try to determine if you've been clear.
    I do this sometimes and it's always helpful to say something like "That
    wasn't super clear, let me elaborate more" or "Sorry, that didn't come out
    the right way, what I mean to say is _______". Emojis can help here, but
    keep in mind that some people hate them and don't display them, so you
    should try to avoid overusing them.

I hope some of these tips help you make better use of Slack!
