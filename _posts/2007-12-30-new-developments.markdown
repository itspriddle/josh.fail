Well, I've just finished building my first site with CodeIgniter, and I have
to say it was an absolute blast. The framework is wonderfull. Using it, I was
able to completely redesign Inglenook Realty in about 3 weeks with leaner,
more sensible code than I had implemented previously. Granted, there is about
twice as much code now as there was previously, but everything works perfectly
now - and I won't need to scrap the whole thing again if the owners want more
revisions down the road. Thank you CI!

I also got around to finishing up a small PHP script I had written called
dyndnsCron. This script can be installed as a cronjob and it will update your
IP address with DynDNS if it changes. It will also automatically make "fake"
changes to your account once a month to make sure it isn't deleted for
inactivity. [Those of us with free DynDNS accounts know all about that...]

If you want to take a gander, its available here:

If I don't make it back here before 08 - happy new year!
