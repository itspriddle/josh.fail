Me and a bunch of friends went to the mall today. I bought someone her X-mas
present. Whooo. Haha, she's lucky she got anything at all because I'm so bad
about shopping. No real updates today. I'm going to try and get the guestbook
to work, but I don't know if I'll be able to do it the way I want, which will
suck ass.
