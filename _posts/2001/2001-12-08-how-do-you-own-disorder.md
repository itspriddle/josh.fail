I'm still lazy as hell. I need to get all of the links working... I won't
though. I'm working on getting the guestbook working right. It's kind of hard
to lay it out so I can get it integrated with my layout. I can really tell you

Well... tonight the junior class, that's mine in case you wanted to know, came
