I went to upload the site and all of my "hard" work from yesterday, and a
fucking thunderstorm started and I had to get off. Then my fucking sister took
over the computer for hours and was like, "Oh, you can get on at 10." 10 came
and my dad was on. I shoulda killed her. I think that I'm going to work on my
guestbook layout today. I never really liked the way it looked and I think it
needs to be fixed.
