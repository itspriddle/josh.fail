There are some stupid girls at school... that explains the whole you can't
come... how do you know thing. I've done like no updating. Haha, then again,
I'm sure that you knew that. I'm really so lazy its sick. Seriously. I never
do anything, I set goals for my site, and they never get met. Who knows why.
Oh well... I'm a lazy fucker. Who really cares?

You MUST go visit Tia. She's going to kill me if I don't put her up with some
hearts. Haha... so go and visit and SIGN HER GUESTBOOK. You better be happy...

I'm making a links page or something soon. I don't know... I mean, I'm
thinking of making a links page soon, so around January it might be up. God I
wish I wasn't so lazy sometimes...
