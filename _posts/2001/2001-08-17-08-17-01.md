So last night I get the great news... my cousin is coming up to stay for like
a week. Boy! Doesn't that sound like fun? No. He's nothing more than a smug
little bastard, and right now I'd love nothing more than to punch him in the
fucking face. He's been here for only 3 hours, and I was so near hitting him
in the face as hard as I could that I had to leave my house. It annoys me that
someone can make me feel like a stranger in my own damn house. I know that
unless I can leave for at least an hour a day I **WILL** hurt him before the
week is done. My sister thinks he stole money from her and if I find out it's
true, it's going to be a family affair that isn't going to be pretty.
