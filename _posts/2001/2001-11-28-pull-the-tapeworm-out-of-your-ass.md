Didn't really do much today... In fact, I was so lazy today, I didn't even
download a picture from my cam for today. Guess you'll just have to deal... I
got Toxicity from a friend today, and its really fucking cool. I can't believe
I hated system for so long... At least I like them now...

Music: System of a Down - Science (FUCKING INCREDIBLE)

NO PICTURE TODAY
