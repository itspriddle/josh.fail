Welcome to the site. Not much is up right now. Over the next week, (vacation)
I am going to be creating and uploading all of the content for it. Expect this
site to be completely up by March. I'm hoping anyway that I can get everything
completed by then. Hopefully... but there are often factors that prevent me
from doing this. Oh well. Either way... If you are looking at this its
probably because you got the link from me. Or someone who already had the
link. Or you clicked on it on accident from dethroned.net's hostees page. At
any rate, if you feel like telling me how badly this site sucks, you can
e.mail me.
