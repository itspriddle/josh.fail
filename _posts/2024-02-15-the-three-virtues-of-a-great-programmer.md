According to Larry Wall(1), the original author of the Perl programming
language, there are three great virtues of a programmer; Laziness, Impatience
and Hubris.

> 1. **Laziness:** The quality that makes you go to great effort to reduce
>    overall energy expenditure. It makes you write labor-saving programs that
>    other people will find useful and document what you wrote so you don't have
>    to answer so many questions about it.
> 2. **Impatience:** The anger you feel when the computer is being lazy. This
>    makes you write programs that don't just react to your needs, but actually
>    anticipate them. Or at least pretend to.
> 3. **Hubris:** The quality that makes you write (and maintain) programs that
>    other people won't want to say bad things about.

So true---especially laziness.
