When I was given a company credit card, I didn't know that vendors would
magically get a hold of my email address to try selling me something.

In _just_ the last 7 days, I've gotten these cold-sales-emails:

1. Kristen has reached out for the 4th time this month to see if I need
   geofencing. She hasn't attempted to explain what it is.
2. Catherine has reached out a 2nd time to see if I need help with
   bottlenecks, to turn time into dollars.
3. Jack has reached out for the 4th time and wants to make my email marketing
   dreams come true.
4. Nancy reached out on Friday because I'm leaving a huge opportunity on the
   table with my website. What it is, or which website, who can guess? I
   expect her follow up this coming Friday.
5. John reached out for the 4th time to schedule a meeting to tell me about
   his Software QA/Testing services. He started a 2nd thread this time just in
   case the first one got lost.
6. Don let me know about a great Ruby developer. For my PHP team. Points for
   potentially skimming my LinkedIn to see I have Ruby experience myself.
7. Emily and Georgia reserved another demo slot for me for their traffic
   insights software. This is the 4th time. They've been at it since April.
8. Kevin wanted me to consider a partner to "help through fractional digital
   and technology resources instead of full-time roles". I think he's selling
   developers?
9. Andrada reached out for the 5th time to sell me IP addresses. She's been at
   it since May.
10. Francis wanted to tell me all about Minimum Viable Products and assured me
    his team is great at them. I wonder what we do with one of their MVPs if
    it worked and we needed to launch an Actual P?
11. Ella wanted to know if I was interested in buying Joomla Software User
    lists. Her CMS is broken though and full of blanks where variables should
    have been present.

It's interesting to spot the different patterns these people are using.
Everyone acknowledges how busy I must be (of course, not so busy I can't find
30 mins to hear their pitches). Most of them know that I have some buying
power in my company, but also have no clue what decisions my team and I are
actually making for the company. At least half of them have no clue what it is
I, you know, do here. But, most of all, they are all persistent and annoying.

I suppose if 99 people say no and 1 says yes, that's still a sale?

Note that this does _not_ include all the webinar invites, random product
emails from vendors I am actually using, or outright spam.

Why not keep a running list of these? How many can I get in a month?

1. 06/21/22: Jenny wants me to check out their smart Slack app that helps
   DevOps and engineering teams **easily manage on-call rotations** (her
   emphasis). This one's actually not a bad idea, but PagerDuty is already a
   thing I'm paying for, you know?
2. 06/21/22: John's timer went off and I got a 5th email about their QA
   Software Testing services.
3. 06/21/22: David assures me agile growing pains are totally normal.
   Thankfully, at his company they _"recognize the remarkable transformative
   potential of unleashing the Agile Ecosystem Triad of People, Framework, and
   Toolchain and what it can do to eliminate silos, reduce waste, enhance
   quality, and adapt the correct tools to drive rapid results while serving
   as a pillar for ongoing continuous improvements the modern Agile way."_
   Yes, it was all one long sentence. Seems like they're [making the world a
   better place][1].
4. 06/21/22: Kate has virtual office hours available to help educate me on
   how medical providers can financially verify their patients pre-service.
   That _is_ a problem that's been keeping me awake at night.
5. 06/21/22: Francis opened a 2nd thread to tell me more about MVPs. He seems
   a bit more to the point this time.
6. 06/22/22: Diane wants to know if my team is just working hard or if they're
   also working _smart_. She's so confident I'll love their forensics
   software's insights into my site's visitors, she's gone ahead and reserved
   a trial for it for me. She also wants me to know they're GDPR compliant
   (but it's somehow totally cool that she's emailing me without me having
   signed up for anything).
7. 06/22/22: Derek is a reliable, US-based partner than can help with my
   current or upcoming projects' development. His firm prides themselves on
   excellent communication and unparalleled expertise.
8. 06/23/22: John offers his sincere apologies if he's bothering me in my busy
   work schedule. He really wants to schedule a call to talk about his QA
   services. It's his 6th attempt.
9. 06/23/22: Kate is back to let me know there is still time for me to
   register for that patient financial verification strategy presentation.
10. 06/23/22: David makes me laugh a second time with his long winded agile
    sales pitch. I don't think I yet recognize the remarkable transformative
    potential of unleashing the Agile Ecosystem Triad.
11. 06/25/22: David, David, David. It's Sunday, my man. Take a break!
12. 06/27/22: Scot hopes I'm doing well and has free trials for top Project
    Management, Construction or accounting tools.
13. 06/27/22: Raja worked for `$BigComany` for 14 years as a GM, he built
    technology teams in India nd now leads a very strong team of technical
    recruiters and project managers as part of a digitalzone with a fine
    office facility. He is not a fan of comas.
14. 06/27/22: Hasham has ruby services from a trustworthy development
    partner if I'm short handed and need help with the development needs.
15. 06/27/22: Ioana wants to talk about my 2022 plans and show me how
    combining cybersecurity and data protection technologies with the cyber
    protection approach can help me protect my clients from data loss and
    cyberthreats.
16. 06/27/22: Andres wants to help me with hiring by focusing on nearshore
    staff augmentation with locality and culture-fit in mind. He's been
    emailing me since Jan 2021 any time a dev spot opened on our website.
17. 06/27/22: Kathy went through my LinkedIn profile and wants to know my
    interest on the below. She'd love to offer "**FREE 0$ POC(Proof of
    Concept)**. They develop Automation script for few complex
    scenarios(shared by me) on my application in any technical stack." Kathy,
    I _wish_ we had "few complex scenarios", but these are computers.
18. 06/27/22: Daviiiid! Are you really going to email me the same thing every
    two days? I guess I'll unsubscribe when it stops being funny.
19. 06/28/22: Grace is sharing my copy of the Maturity Model for IT
    Orchestration & Automation today! Their "tiered framework made up of five
    distinct levels of automation maturity" is one that my organization "can
    use to self-assess [out] automation readiness and develop a sound strategy
    for moving forward." I am realizing that "framework" is probably a great
    way to flag the _real_ bullshitters in my inbox. Also "triad."
20. 06/28/22: Kara has been working with a skilled Software Developer she
    thinks would be a great fit for my company. I'm not sure what those skills
    are. If that person's not a good fit, she has others!
21. 06/28/22: Edmond is thrilled to share with me that they are officially an
    Atlassian Cloud Specialized Partner! I think they offer consulting for
    Atlassian, but they really want me to read their presser about this new
    certification.
22. 06/29/22: Kara is following up again. Today she has multiple devs she's
    working with. I hope the person from yesterday found something!
23. 06/29/22: Vijay hopes I'm having a great week. He saw I am hiring (I'm
    not) and wants me to send him my leads. He's got offshore devs available
    for my next project. I guess I'm supposed to show him my leads so he can
    tell me that he can come in cheaper?
24. 06/29/22: Maria's accomplished teams have delivered software across
    different tech verticals such as Product Design, Custom Software
    Development, Fintech, CMS, Web/App Development, Machine/Deep Learning,
    A.I, Travel Technology, DBA, and more. She wants to collaborate. I do love
    me a good vertical.
25. 06/29/22: Derek has reached out a few times but hasn't heard back (Dear
    Slim...). He also wants to sell me developers.
26. 06/30/22: Tommy writes, with the subject "No Ringo, but they are all
    STARRS":  "**Hey Jude**... sorry, Joshua!". He's got 3 devs who are
    looking for **HELP!** Fortunately, none of them live in a **Yellow
    Submarine** and would love to work for me in office or remotely. We can
    **Come Together** to discuss them. **Let It Be** known that if I need
    different skills, Tommy's got 'em. He can help me with anything with a
    **Little Help From My Friends**. Dude. I hate the Beatles --- and this
    sales tactic. Also, wasn't Ringo the one everyone hated?
27. 06/30/22: Andrew found himself scrolling through my website and social
    channels and he must say, he loves what I've got going on. They specialize
    in SEO and are so confident in their work and ranking me on the first page
    of Google. I wonder how he found us if I need so much SEO work ðŸ¤”
28. 06/30/22: Kate really wants me to join those office hours to extract value
    from unstructured data in healthcare. I still don't know what that is, but
    the more you ask me about it, Kate, the more I feel it's something that
    ought to be illegal.
29. 07/01/22: Kara hasn't heard back so she wanted to touch base again. She
    wants to sell me developers in Q3.
30. 07/01/22: Erik wants to schedule a call to learn about my active dev
    projects and explore ways they can provide immediate relief to my talent
    needs and become and on-demand asset for my team. These recruiters and
    programmer sweat shops sure do love their word salads.
31. 07/01/22: Jenna is a director at a US-based innovative business solutions
    firm. They have offices an resources throughout LATAM to help scale my IT
    and software development teams.
32. 07/05/22: Kate has even more medical virtual office hours. I guess they do
    them weekly?
33. 07/05/22: Ioana is back and says "A lot of MSPs struggle to manage a stack
    of vendors and still end up with unreliable protection for their clients."
    I'd have no clue what she's trying to sell if they weren't already a
    vendor of ours I've heard about. Now that I think about it, what _is_ she
    trying to sell me if we're already their customers?
34. 07/05/22: Ozan would like to schedule a call to talk about their
    "innovative platform capable of managing and optimizing exponential
    amounts of data all in real-time, at the edge." He faked his email to look
    like the subject came from LinkedIn.
35. 07/06/22: Sounds like Kara has gotten the point that I'm not actually
    hiring.
36. 07/06/22: Francis tells me "Thereâ€™s an easy solution to your problem:
    outsourcing." No, I think the answer is UNSUBSCRIBE when I'm done with
    this little experiment.
37. 07/06/22: Stephen wants to sell me the same stuff that Ioana does. I
    wonder if they're talking to each other at all? Do they [split that
    commish][2] if I sign up?
38. 07/06/22: Ken writes to tell me "Low-code app development means you can
    build apps and workflows faster than ever and with less complexity." I
    loathe no-code solutions. I bet "low-code" ones are _worse_ and that I'd
    have to learn a half-baked programming language to be semi-productive. One
    Size Fits Noneâ„¢.
39. 07/06/22: Madhukar outlined a pull request that happened at his work and
    how their software removes me needing to be in a standup. He wants to know
    if that's the "the silent, efficient, social collaboration of work Zen you
    want to bring to your life as well?" No, I don't want to work in silence.
    Standups can not suck if you do them right.
40. 07/06/22: Jenna is just floating her email back to the top of my inbox.
    There's something uniquely irritating about that.
41. 07/07/22: Lucy tells me that Ernest Hemingway said "customer experience is
    all about the journey---a journey that's most effective when it includes
    moments of personalized, relevant content." I'll admit I've never read any
    Hemingway... but somehow I doubt he ever mentioned customer service. She's
    trying to sell a modern CMS and DAM (she doesn't mention what they are).
42. 07/07/22: Shannon has good news: a key decision-maker from your ideal
    customer just visited your website! Bad news: they left your website
    without getting in touch with you. Her forensics software can help. She
    wants to know what day works best for me next week to talk. I like the
    assertiveness---don't make me think about it!
43. 07/08/22: Brandon says (demands?) "we need to talk, Joshua". They are US
    based and offer flexible engagement options such as Staff Augmentation,
    Team Delivery and Project delivery. Their Net Promoter Score is 75%. I
    know enough about NPS to know you're probably gaming things to be in the
    70s, but nice flex.
44. 07/08/22: James is following up from a thread in April. They're a unique
    Software Outsourcing company that employs only the Top 1% Software
    Engineers in Latin America.
45. 07/08/22: David is back. "If you're struggling to combine your long-term
    planning and agile development - you're not alone!" If I am not
    struggling, am I alone?
46. 07/10/22: David! For the love of god, take the hint dude. You do not need
    to email me every Friday and Sunday. I promise, I am not giving you any
    money.
47. 07/11/22: Kathy isn't sure if I've been able to review her prior email.
    She still wants to collaborate with the below mentioned Testing POC for
    free of cost.
48. 07/11/22: Jenna reminds me she's from that "nearshore staff augmentation
    firm that provides operational and IT services to companies looking to
    scale in the most efficient and cost-effective way without sacrificing
    quality." These people should read their emails aloud to taste the word
    salad for themselves.
