When I was given a company credit card, I didn't know that vendors would
magically get a hold of my email address to try selling me something.

In _just_ the last 7 days, I've gotten these cold-sales-emails:

1. Kristen has reached out for the 4th time this month to see if I need
   geofencing.
2. Catherine has reaching out a 2nd time to see if I need help with
   bottlenecks, to turn time into dollars.
3. Jack has reached out for the 4th time and wants to make my email marketing
   dreams come true.
4. Nancy reached out on Friday because I'm leaving a huge opportunity on the
   table with my website. I expect her follow up this coming Friday.
5. John reached out for the 4th time to schedule a meeting to tell me about
   his Software QA/Testing services. He started a 2nd thread this time just in
   case the first one got lost.
6. Don let me know about a great Ruby developer. For my PHP team. Points for
   potentially skimming my LinkedIn to see I have Ruby experience myself.
7. Emily and Georgia reserved another demo slot for me for their traffic
   insights software. This is the 4th time. They've been at it since April.
8. Kevin wanted me to consider a partner to "help us through fractional digital
   and technology resources instead of full-time roles".
9. Andrada reached out for the 5th time to sell me IP addresses. She's been at
   it since May.
10. Francis wanted to tell me all about Minimum Viable Products and assured me
    his team is great at them.
11. Ella wanted to know if I was interested in buying Joomla Software User
    lists. Her CMS is broken though and full of blanks where variables should
    have been present.

It's interesting to spot the different patterns these people are using.
Everyone acknowledges how busy I must be (of course, not so busy I can't find
30 mins to hear their pitches). Most of them know that I have some buying
power in my company, but also have no clue what decisions my team and I are
actually making for the company. But, most of all, they are all persistent
and annoying.

I suppose if 99 people say no and 1 says yes, that's still a sale, though.

Why not keep a running list of these? How many can I get in a month?

1. 06/21/22: Jenny wants me to check out their smart Slack app that helps
   DevOps and engineering teams **easily manage on-call rotations** (her
   emphasis).
2. 06/21/22: John's timer went off and I got a 5th email about their QA
   Software Testing services.
3. 06/21/22: David assures me agile growing pains are totally normal.
   Thankfully, at his company they "recognize the remarkable transformative
   potential of unleashing the Agile Ecosystem Triad of People, Framework, and
   Toolchain and what it can do to eliminate silos, reduce waste, enhance
   quality, and adapt the correct tools to drive rapid results while serving
   as a pillar for ongoing continuous improvements the modern Agile way." Yes,
   it was all one long sentence.
4. 06/21/22: Kate has virtual office hours available to help educate me on
   how medical providers can financially verify their patients pre-service.
5. 06/21/22: Francis opened a 2nd thread to tell me more about MVPs.
