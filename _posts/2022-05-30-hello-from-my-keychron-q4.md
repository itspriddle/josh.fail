Just grabbed a [Keychron Q4][1] and giving it the ol' blog-post-typing-test.

I tried red switches on this one. I think I prefer browns, but we'll see. I
think I'm going to miss the arrow keys a ton, especially for recalling shell
history.

Now that I've got another decent backup, time to tear apart the Q2 and make it
a thoccy boi.
