I just had a hell of a time trying to unzip a bunch of zip's on Linux.

Long story short, to unzip all zip files in a directory run <strong>unzip \*.zip</strong>

You can use <strong>-o</strong> to overwrite files with the same filename without being prompted, or <strong>-n</strong> to never overwrite files.

I'll need this later... I'm sure.
