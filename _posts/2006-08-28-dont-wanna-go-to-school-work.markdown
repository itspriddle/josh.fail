I truly hate VT from midnight to 8am. If I'm lucky I _won't_ come in to 10
people on hold with hour+ wait times. If I'm lucky, they _won't_ call at all
and I'll be able to get some tickets done.

**I'm not lucky - I never have been.**

To top it off - or rather, lay the foundation of the cake, I get to go to ITT
first.

Awesome, I hate that place all the time. I'm almost done with this quarter
though.

Going to do HW and hate life for 12 hours.
