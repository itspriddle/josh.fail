I picked up some [new keycaps][1] from Drop. I'm writing this post to test
them a little... but I think I may be in love.

I actually bought a [Keychron Q2 Pro][2] to go with them, but I stupidly
grabbed an ISO layout that I can't stand. Total waste of money since Keychron
sucks with returns. Maybe I'll try selling or gifting it to one of my
international coworkers...
