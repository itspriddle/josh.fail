Saying hi from my new Keychrone Q2 Pro, the proper ANSI one this time.

Instead of a barebones, I went with a pre-built model with Keychron K Pro
Banana switches and their stock KSA Double-Shot PBT keycaps.

I think I am in love üòç! Glad to finally be wireless again, too.

On the plus side, I found someone to take the ISO Q2 off my hands.
