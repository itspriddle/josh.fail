About 27 or 28 years ago, I found myself in my mom's white 1990 Honda Prelude
SI while my she was perusing a garage sale. I was bored quickly and started
rummaging through the glove box. I found a tape labeled "Ozzy Live & Loud" and
decided to pop it in. Little did I know that I was about to be
absolutely mind blown by [Mr. Zakk Wylde on guitar][1].

I stole the tape, which was my dad's. Ozzy Osbourne's _Live & Loud_ became my
world for a few years. Especially [Mr. Crowley][2]. That first guitar solo üëå
üçù

Can we talk about how incredible the mix on _Live & Loud_ is? I eventually
figured out Randy Rhodes actually wrote _Mr Crowley_, so I bought _Blizzard of
Ozz_. And I absolutely hated how it sounded---thin and weak in comparison to
the brutality of _Live & Loud_. My dad, having listened to the studio release
for 10+ years, thought it sounded fine. I sold it to him for $10.

Someone posted this image on Reddit the other day and I had a fun little trip
down memory lane listening to _Live & Loud_. Still good after all these years!
