[This article][1] outlines some hidden functions you can get with the FN key
on macOS.

> - **Fn-A:** Selects an item in the Dock, after which you can use the arrow keys to select different items and press Return to switch to the app
> - **Fn-Shift-A:** Opens Launchpad
> - **Fn-C:** Opens Control Center
> - **Fn-D:** Starts dictation (or set a modifier key to do this when you press it twice)
> - **Fn-E:** Open the emoji picker (same as choosing Edit > Emoji & Symbols)
> - **Fn-F:** Toggles full-screen mode
> - **Fn-H:** Hides current windows to reveal the desktop; a second press restores them
> - **Fn-M:** Selects the Apple menu, after which you can use the arrow keys to navigate menus and activate the selected command by pressing Return
> - **Fn-N:** Displays Notification Center
> - **Fn-Q:** Starts a new Quick Note in Notes
> - **Fn-Delete:** Forward delete on keyboards without a Forward Delete key (or use Control-D)
> - **Fn-Return:** Equivalent to the Enter key on the numeric keypad, which is slightly different than Return in certain contexts
> - **Fn-Up Arrow:** Scroll up one page (same as the Page Up key)
> - **Fn-Down Arrow:** Scroll down one page (same as the Page Down key)
> - **Fn-Left Arrow:** Scroll to the beginning of a document (same as the Home key)
> - **Fn-Right Arrow:** Scroll to the end of a document (same as the End key)

I wonder if there's a way to trigger it from a [QMK keyboard][2]...
