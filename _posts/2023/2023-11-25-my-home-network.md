I thought I'd document my home network, or at least the more interesting parts.

### Domain

I own `priddle.network` and use it exclusively for my home network.

I use DigitalOcean to manage my DNS. `acme.sh` and friends all support DO's
DNS API so it's a great way to get SSL certificates for my internal sites. I
guess I don't really need it, but it's easy to setup with an Nginx proxy, so
I've been doing it.

### Modem/Internet

I use an [ARRIS SURFboard DOCSIS 3.0 cable modem][modem] to connect to
Spectrum for Internet. Spectrum manages it entirely via TFTP... but it does
belong to me.

I get about 300Mbps down and 10Mbps up from Spectrum.

### Router

I run [OPNsense][opnsense] on a [Protectli FW4B][router].

I'm not doing anything too fancy with it. I setup `priddle.network` as my
network name and then use OPNsense's DHCP and Unbound modules to set custom
DNS records for every machine on my network. I also setup DHCP to assign my
two Pi-holes as DNS servers for most of the machines on the network (aside
from my wife's work computer).

### Switches

For ethernet, I am using a cheap [24-port TP-Link switch][24-port switch]. I
have a few PoE devices that I power with a [5 port TP-Link PoE switch][poe
switch].

I also have an [8-port Netgear switch][8-port switch]. My coax input is on the
opposite side of my office and most of this gear is in a small [9u
rack][network rack] in the closet. This switch, the cable modem, and router
are plugged in and hidden behind a cabinet.

### WiFi

For WiFi, I recently switched to an [Ubiquiti U6 Pro][wifi] that I run in
standalone mode. I'm not sure yet if I'll switch my router out to an Ubiquiti
gateway. For my apartment, the U6 Pro works just fine.

### Pi-hole DNS servers

I run two instances of Pi-hole, one on a [Raspberry Pi 4 Model B Rev 1.1][rpi
4b] with 2gb of RAM, and another on an older [Raspberry Pi 3 Model B Plus Rev
1.3][rpi 3b+] with 1gb of RAM. They each use a [UCTRONICS PoE hat][poe hat] for
power.

### NAS

For my NAS, I am using a [Synology DS1522+][nas]. It has 2 [WD Red Plus
10tb][wd-red 10tb] drives and 3 [WD Red 12gb][wd-red 12tb] drives---for about
40tb of total storage. I upgraded to [32gb of RAM][nas ram] and threw in a couple
[400gb Synology SSDs][nas ssd] for about 745gb of caching.

I primarily use the NAS for sharing media files and for backups (via
TimeMachine and manual ones).

I'm also running Docker on it and run Deluge and a Git server on it.

I'm using about 17tb of storage today and have 21tb free.

I just got a [Tripp Lite SMART1500LCD][ups] to protect it from power outages.

### Media

I've been using Plex since 2016 on Ubuntu with a Gigabyte Intel i3-4010U
(Amazon no longer lists it). Plex has been giving me trouble lately with
playback and I've been wanting to upgrade the hardware a little. I just got a
new [Beelink i5 mini PC][beelink] on sale and switched from Plex to Emby. So
far, so good.

We have 3 TVs and each has an [Apple TV 4K][apple tv] attached with two
[HomePods][homepod] (a 1st generation set in my office, and 2nd generation set
each in the living room and bedroom).

Our 2 bathrooms each have [HomePod minis][homepod mini], mainly so we can yell
at Siri from the shower to add shampoo or soap to our grocery list.

### Printing

I have a 9 year old [Brother HL-2270DW][brother printer] that works great and
I refuse to upgrade. We've bought toner every 2 years or so. I put
[Printopia][printopia] on my Mac to make it work with AirPrint for our phones
and iPads. I plan on using it until it dies (ðŸ¤ž).

### IoT: Lights/Automation

For lights and automation, I have mostly [Hue][hue lights] color lights.
They're expensive, but they are definitely better than the alternatives.

I've tried [innr White Smart Bulbs][innr white lights] and they work great
software-wise, they don't seem to dim as well as the real Hue lights.

In our living room we have: 3 Hue color lights and a fixture with 2 white Hue
lights.

In our kitchen we have a single fixture with 3 innr white lights.

My office has 4 Hue color lights and an innr color light strip around my TV
stand.

Our bedroom has 2 color Hue lights, one on each nightstand.

When we go out of town, I have 3 [Logitech Circle View Cameras][circle view]
for spying on our cats.

Outside we run a  [meross Outdoor Wi-Fi Outlet][outdoor plug] to control
Christmas decorations with Siri.

I also have a few [meross Smart Plug Minis][smart plug] to control our
Christmas tree lights and a couple other old school lights.

Technically our bed (Tempurpedic) is a smart bed, too. We also have a Roomba.
I pretty much leave them alone besides letting Pi-hole block any tracking they
try to do.

### Personal Computers/Mobile Devices

This section needs a post of its own, but the personal computers we have are:

- Me:
    - Mac mini M2 Pro (2023)
    - MacBook Air M1 (2020)
    - iPhone 15 Pro (2023)
    - iPad Pro 2nd gen (2020)
    - iPad mini 6th gen (2021)

    - MacBook Air Intel i3 (2016)
    - iPhone 15 Pro (2023)
    - iPad Pro 1st gen (2018)

We have quite a few gaming systems too but I'm not doing anything interesting
with them network-wise.

Since OPNsense has support for vnstat, here's what the WAN usage on my router
looked like (i.e. traffic in/out from the internet):

| month   | rx         | tx         | total      | avg. rate   |
| ------- | ---------: | ---------: | ---------: | ----------- |
| Dec '22 | 1.24 TiB   | 74.59 GiB  | 1.31 TiB   | 4.31 Mbit/s |

| Sep '23 | 1.18 TiB   | 85.44 GiB  | 1.27 TiB   | 4.30 Mbit/s |
| Oct '23 | 1.23 TiB   | 82.32 GiB  | 1.31 TiB   | 4.29 Mbit/s |
| Nov '23 | 904.41 GiB | 70.79 GiB  | 975.20 GiB | 3.73 Mbit/s |

Most of that is Google Meet/Skype video calls from my wife and I with work. I
took a trip for work in August and it definitely shows in our bandwidth usage.
