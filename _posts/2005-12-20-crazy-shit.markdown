Haha yeah... so my parents and my sister had World War fucking 3 last night.
If I had recorded it no one would ever had believed it was real.

Anyway, the festivities concluded with my sister packing her shit and leaving.
All her shit is still here so I dont know what the fuck that means.

Haha, she and my parents are all three fucking retarded.  She's an idiot if
she thinks what she's fighting for is worth all of this bullshit.  My parents
are idiots for thinking that they're really protecting her by denying her what
she wants.

Its fucking hilarious how they think their doing "the right thing" for her and
yet they're driving her out of the house.

If I were her I'd probably leave too, and never fucking look back.  Then
again.. she's 18 and broke.  The rents are banking on this, praying to god
that she comes to her senses, dumps him, and comes home.

I got a serious fucking question for the two of you if you see this:  What
happens if she DOESN'T dump him?  You're really prepared to abandon her for
life because you don't agree with her choices?  That's pretty fucked up.
That's hardly parenting either.

All three of you fucked up big time on this one.  You guys will be lucky if
you ever have any sort of trusting relationship again.  None of you has the
slightest clue what you're getting into.
