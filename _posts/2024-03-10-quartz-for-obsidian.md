I recently discovered [Quartz][1], a static site generator that works great
with [Obsidian][2].

I've been using it to publish my notes to a public site, and I'm really happy
with the results. I wrote a [note][3] about how I set it up on GitHub Pages,
and I'm planning to write more about how I'm using it.
