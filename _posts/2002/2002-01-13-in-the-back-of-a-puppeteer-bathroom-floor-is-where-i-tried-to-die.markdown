I went to the coolest party yesterday with all my friends. Haha, it was
supposed to be a suprise b-day party for my friend Zach, but it was for me too
and I didn't know. So I got there early because my sister didn't make sure I
was late like she was supposed to... loser. It was cool though, we made the
Shanimal eat like 35 mozzarella sticks, and Kate and Jamie tried killing
eachother with a little cake. I got some CD's from my friend Ryan. LOL, and I
got movie passes to a place I've never even heard of. I'll make Jamie show me
where it is i guess...

THANKS FOR THE PARTY JAIM!
