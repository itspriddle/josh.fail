10:49 PM EST: The new layout is pretty much done. I like it quite a bit too.
Its pretty basic, but I used some cool tricks I figured out. (I'm so fucking
smart!)

8:59 PM EST: I've been working on a new layout. Actually, the layout will
pretty much be the same, I'm just trying out some new tricks I just taught
myself in Fireworks. Hah! We all knew how long this whole "simple layout"
thing would last for me.

I bought a book today. The Manhatten Hunt Club by John Saul. If you don't know
who he is, you should get one of his books. He writes incredible
horror/mystery books. I stole a pen also. I know, I'm such a rebel.

12:29 AM EST: I need to really get off my ass and make a half way decent
layout of this site. For some reason I can't be bothered to make a shitty
layout. I need something with like 300 layers in Fireworks. Don't you love how
I ramble on about advanced programs like everyone in the world knows what I'm
talking about? I do!

I've had enough of this shit for tonight. I think I'm going to go watch Leno
and read The Perks Of Being a Wallflower again. It's calling me.
