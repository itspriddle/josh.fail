10:22 PM EST: Just reformated my computer, finally. Everything seems to be
running pretty smoothly...

I've got a ton of shit to do tomorrow. I have to go out with my mother
sometime to get my hair cut and to buy whatever I still need for school. This
means I'm going to go out and make her buy me shit that I don't really need,
but want anyway. It'll suck ass, I'm sure. Shopping with parents is always
shitty, for me at least.

FUCK I don't want to go to school. They always ruin perfectly good summers by
going, "OHH ITS SEPTEMBER! TIME FOR YOU TO COME TO SCHOOL AND TAKE CLASSES YOU
DIDN'T SIGN UP FOR. YOUR GUIDANCE COUNSELOR IS INCOMPETANT, BUT WE PAY HER
ANYWAY. SHE IS YOUR GOD." Fuck Galway.

6:14 PM EST: My computer is totally fucked up right now. I've needed to
reformat for about a month now, but I'm so lazy. I need to finish the other
sections of this site too. They'll start off small at first because I don't
just want to copy everything from my other site over to this one. There's just
no point.

I really need to read my book for english class. I spent the last 2 days
running all over the place with Mike and Steph, then Tony too. At least it
isn't due until next Tuesday. I have a funny feeling, though, that I'll be up
until 3AM on Monday night finishing what I've put off the entire summer.
