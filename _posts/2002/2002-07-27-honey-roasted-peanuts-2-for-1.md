If they are only one dollar for two, why haven't i bought them before? And
since I only ate one, who ate the other one? Is it hiding in my pantry
someplace? Ya know, if I wasn't so fucking lazy, I might go look for it. They
were pretty good peanuts though. Well, that was just a wonderful little tale
from a day of my life. Pondering the whereabouts of 50Â¢ snack foods. What a
fucking joy it is to be me.

12:55PM - Im sorry that half of the shit on here isnt working yet and that
everything on the right has the same thing written almost... everything will
be fixed in a few days when I release 3.1
