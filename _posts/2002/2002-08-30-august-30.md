10:46 PM EST: Why is it that EVERY fucking name on AIM is taken already? I
tried making "the color jade" earlier. Taken. So instead I'm stuck with "the
colour jade" which just looks wrong. This is from Chimaira too by the way...
Jade is an awesome song you should download it. Fuck AIM. I'm off to work on
something else.

The fucking school gave me B lunch. This means I get to eat with 9th and 10th
graders at 11 o'clock. That fucking sucks. Oh yeah, all of my friends will be
in C lunch. Fucking school. I swear to God they are all retarded.

12:18 AM EST: Okay, I was almost done, but I just heard a commercial. If you
people hate Andrew WK, please tell me! Holy fuck I hate him. His CD has like
17 songs on it, and 10 of them have the word "party" in the title. He's a
fucking homo. Dumb fuck Jack Osbourne put him on the Ozzfest bill. I should
slap them both.

I'm going to go beat my dog because he's making himself bald.

12:12 AM EST: I'm about done with the layout of this.

I'm gonna upload this shit later today (like in 10-12 hours after I SLEEP for
a while...) For now though, I think I'm going to go watch some TV and maybe
read some of the book I had to buy today. I may read the The Perks of Being a
Wallflower some more though.
