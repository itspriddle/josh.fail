10:55 AM EST: School sucks so bad. Holy shit, you have no fucking clue. DL
classes are so boring. You can't even sleep either because youre on camera in
like 3 different schools so they'd be like "OH MY GOD THERES A KID FUCKING
SLEEPING!" Yeah, its all pretty much boring. Oh and my art teacher's a bitch,
and art was supposed to be the two classes I'd like. Well fuck that idea.

Taproot is the only thing good in life. Well, no... but dude, do they kick ass
or what?

10:37 PM EST: I really want to sneak out and get drunk with Mike in a few. I
won't though. I'm always too fucking worried about getting in trouble to ever
do anything. I really fucking hate this shit so bad. You have no idea. I can't
wait until I'm 18... it probably won't change shit though. Things will just be
the same as they always have been and probably always will be. No... I take
that back. I'm not going to do this shit when I leave here.

I'm not gonna fucking sit at home every fucking night watching TV. I'm not
gonna tell people "No, I can't do that, I'll be in trouble." I'm sick of this
bullshit, you people have seriously, no fucking clue how monotanous this all
has become.

But you wanna know something? It doesn't even matter anymore to me. In less
than a year I'm going to be gone to college, and I won't have to hear people
telling me what to do. Haha.. its just like the closer I get, the farther away
it seems.

Oh fucking well.
