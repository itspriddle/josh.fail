Haha, sorry I haven't written anything in a while. I've
been working on a project for a local auto-shop, so all of my free time has
been going into that rather than this site, which I'm not being paid to make.

Oh yeah, Mike Emerson is back from the Navy. Just for a few days though... we
went to this restaurant yesterday... holy shit the woman there was fat and
nasty. The food sucked too, we ordered a pizza burger. She was like "Ohh its
delicious. Its a burger with mozzarella cheese melted, and pizza sauce. The
sauce was actually spaghetti sauce, which I don't care who says otherwise, is
not the same as pizza sauce. There were huge ass tomato chunks in it too, Then
they put our tomato from the burger, which both of us said we DIDN'T want,
under the buns. It was fucking gross.
