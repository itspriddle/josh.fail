10:47 PM EST: I haven't updated this shit in a month. Haha... I haven't even
uploaded any of this shit to silverfire yet. I probably never will. I'm lazy
like that.

I'm about to go out with Mike and Steph. I think that we're going to Tony's to
chill. By chill, I mean get fucked out of my mind. Haha, I can hardly wait!

Oh yeah, in case you cared... I'm starting a web design studio soon. Yay! I'm
so excited. LOL. I'll probably make 0 dollars, but oh fucking well.
