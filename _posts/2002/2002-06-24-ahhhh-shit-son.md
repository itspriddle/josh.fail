Working on the site again... I had some problems with the frames and the way i
wanted the site to look. Any you know what I've decided? Frames are just for
fucking dumb asses who are just too simple to use tables. Well, no... not
really. There are a lot of sites that are good that use frames, but its just
easier once you get into advanced design to use tables. (i know this probably
doesn't look advanced, but what else would you call 3 years of fuckign with
dreamweaver?)

I also went over to Mikes and uploaded 60 megs of pictures. OVER 600 FUCKING
PICTURES! Shit... Its gonna be a pain right in the ass to make a gallery for
all of them, but oh fucking well. I need to do it.
