title: An update for Zach
category: vault

This is for that fuckhead Zach who keeps complaining that I never update. I
know that I never do, but I dont need HIM telling me that i dont. FUCKER! LOL,
JK... actually I'm just kind of wasting some space so i can tell what this
will look like once things get going. Maybe ill even keep this version alive
even though its just a revamped layout from november 2000. It was supposed to
go on silverfire, but fuck that. its too hard. i give up.

look for 500-600 pictures of me and my friends at school and other places
doing often stupid shit. everyone's been bugging me to get the fuckign
digi-pics up, so im finally going to do it as soon as i make a cd or something
and have mike upload it. itll take me WAY too long to upload them myself. im
just a poor bastard on dial up...
