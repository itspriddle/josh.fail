10:04 PM EST: School sucks. After all the work I did to get my camera for
school, I'm told by the new art teacher that I can use any medium for my
portfolio BUT photography. This is fucking wonderful.

At the moment I'm trying desperately to download 3D Studio Max and Poser. I
know I probably won't be able to use either one of them though. That sucks. I
need to start making digital art though.
