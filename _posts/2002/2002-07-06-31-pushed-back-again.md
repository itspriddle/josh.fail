title: 3.1 pushed back again...

Once again the release of 3.1 has been pushed back due to this new release,
3.03. But at least you can look around and see that I am actually working on
this shit. I took a Mudvayne poster and scanned it in, fixed some scratches
and shit that were on it, and fixed it up nice. I added in some simple shapes
in Fireworks to make a better looking layout. I actually like this one quite a
bit. I also changed the color scheme, red and yellow are colors i dont use
enough.

Anyway... I'm out of school finally so I will be able to work on this some. I
know last year I said the same thing when the end of school came, and Ive only
had 2 official versions of Zero released, one of which was pathetically
lacking in content. Oh well... maybe I'm destined never to have a site called
zero...

If anyone wants to make a My Ruin, Ill Ni√±o, or Chimaira site drop drop me a
line. I'm too lazy to get going and I could use a partner.
