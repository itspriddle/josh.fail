I doubt it. I seriously don't think that anyone visits this site, besides
girls in my grade who want to see pictures of everyone when they have sleep
overs or whatever the fuck they like to call them.

I'd like to say that I've been busy making layouts for people and getting tons
of cash. I'd like to say that I've been so busy working on the layout for
Nevercraft Studios that's going to change my life.

Well, fuck you I haven't been.

I've been sniffing glue for the past 3 months so suck it.

ON ANOTHER NOTE: Who knows if there will ever be another version of zero.
