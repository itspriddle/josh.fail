What's up? Happy delayed New Year to anyone who is visiting this... I'm always
slow and late with that kind of shit. Got some ideas for this site, but I
honestly don't know if I'll ever be motivated enough to implement them. I got
a new computer, so it should be relatively easy for me to when I feel like it.
Haha, anyone who ever has been to one or two of my sites knows that I never
feel like it. I'm lazy and at least I know it.

I have a brother who is a drug addict. I'm very proud of him. Not really...
but I wish I did. Haha... its from Slaves on Dope. If you don't have their CD
then I order you to go to the store and buy it, or steal one.
