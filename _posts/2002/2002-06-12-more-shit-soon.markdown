I'm still working on the main layout, but i think that i've just about got
everything done. Some content soon hopefully... i think that im going to work
on the beautiful people section first... no its not a marilyn manson shrine,
but the incredibly ingenous name i cam up with for the section that will have
all of the pics of my friends and shit. wooo... youre excited i can tell.
