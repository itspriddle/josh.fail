11:40 PM EST: Mike's birthday party was today. It was pretty cool. Me, Josh,
Mike, Steph, Tony, Rich, Nick, and Rick all hung out. I took hella pictures of
Mike and Tony trying to kill eachother. Haha, they'll be funny if I ever get
the money to have them developed. Photography is so expensive...

Oh yeah, last night I decided I want to go to the Hallmark Institute of
Photography. I've been planning on going to the Art Institute in Boston for
the last year, but I just changed my mind. LOL, I'm sure I'll change it again
though.

Me and Josh went to a concert tonight. It was just some local bands. The first
band we missed. I heared the suck though. The second band sucked ass. They
were just a shitty punk band. Twinklestick kicked ass. Their guitar player is
godly. The singer was fucking incredible too. I bought a demo of theirs, but
it kinda sucks in quality. The last band, The Multi...something, were good
too. The bass player blew goat sac. The singer and drummer were good though.
They want Josh to join as the bass player. I need to get a live rig so then I
can be in a band. Anyway... my parents bitched at me because I didn't have a
ride home. Fuck them.

I'm off for some sleep.
