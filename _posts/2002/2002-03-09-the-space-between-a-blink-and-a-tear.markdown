Holy shit I never update things... well its been 3 fucking months since I've
even thought about this site. I think that I'm going to make it into a
personal site for myself since things don't really fit into what I want to do
with zero. I don't know what will be here, probably some shit about my
friends, gay pictures of me, and maybe a few songs I like. Mmm... nothing
incredible.
