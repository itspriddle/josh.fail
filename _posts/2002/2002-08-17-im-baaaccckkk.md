Sorry that I've been gone for so long. I've been working on a side project for
some dinero. I finished the other day so now you all get to enjoy my rantings
once again! YAY!

Well, there's really nothing new going on. I put the money I got from that
site into the bank. It took me all day to find a bank that would let me open a
checking account so I could get a debit card. Haha... then the one I did find
would only put the card in my mom's name. So now I've got starter checks,
which everyone knows are completely and utterly useless. I should have just
put my money into the bank of Josh, a big dirty sock.

I got my digicam back from Tony's house finally. Now you'll all be able to
have erotic fantasies about me and have pictures to go with them! Aww you're
so lucky that I'm always giving for you!

Uhg... sooner or later I'm going to fix the guestbook. It's not like any one
is flocking to sign it, HINT HINT HINT..
