It's too bad Linkin Park has to rap. It really is. Some of their lyrics are
really good, but they fucking rap. Brad Delson is my new hero too. He's so
fucking creative with harmonics on the guitar. Anyone who doesn't play won't
know what I'm talking about... Harmonics are the high pitched echoey things
you might hear on a song like In The End, or in the intro to Death Blooms from
MuDvAyNe.
