title: Twilight Princess (Part 4)

Believe it or not, I actually had to put this game on hold for some work at
ITT.

But now that that's finished, I've picked up full force.

I have to say, the best 'advance' this game has over the others I've played,
is the double clawshots. These little sassies, allow you to swing from perch
to perch like your friendly neighborhood Spiderman.

I'm in the middle of the Sky Palace... and I'm sure anyone who has gotten
through it just had a small laugh. The thing is ENORMOUS! I've been in here
for probably 2-3 hours and there is still no sign of ever getting out.

Currently, I'm stuck in the middle of a room with a massive fan blade blocking
my path. WHERE OH WHERE IS THE OFF SWITCH!?!

I might actually shut it off early tonight. This is too frustrating.
