Linux is fuckin great.

I get to school and I have not one but two quizzes I didn't know about...
Hah, I did better than Tony...

After that we got to go to lab...  The lab, seriously, took me all of 10
minutes to complete.

Haha, then I get home, and there's an email from the Dean of the school saying
"We missed you yesterday in Website Design class,"...  Uhh... I definately
made an appearance...  Stupid ass teacher probably doesn't know who I am... on
that note I doubt he knows who he is.

Everyone up there is absolutely insane...  Absolutely.

Time to Inglenook it up bitches.
