I found a few random old site designs on my NAS.

Childs Automotive was the first site I got paid for.

Dethroned-Nevercraft was my buddy Tony and I ping-ponging ideas to make a
collab site.

Sacred Heart Foundation was me and Tony again bouncing ideas off each other
for a client project (I think decided they didn't need a website).

![]({{ "/images/posts/2022/sacred.heart.03.jpg" | relative_url }})
