Does anyone remember the show 'In Living Color'?  There was one skit, done by
Jim Carey, called Fire Marshall Bill.  Bill was an insane old fireman who
always tried to come to the aid of people, but ended up going nuts over the
stupidest forms of fire.

Some nickelodeon show has stolen it with a teen volunteer fireman.

This is just horrible.
