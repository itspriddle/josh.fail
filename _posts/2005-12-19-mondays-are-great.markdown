I beat the shit out of Tales of Symphonia yesterday. Honestly, I was a little
disappointed with how easy it was. It takes way too long to play again on
hard, so I think I'll avoid that.

I've been fighting for a fucking month with Godaddy.com to get Crawford
Insurance's website back online. They're fucking assholes, every time they
send me to the same BROKEN PAGE! I want to fucking scream!

40 Below Summer and some eats will do me good.
