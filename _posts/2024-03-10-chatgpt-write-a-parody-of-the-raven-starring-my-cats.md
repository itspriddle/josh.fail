ChatGPT, write a parody of The Raven starring my cats...

> Once upon a sunlit morning, while I snored, my dreams adorning,
> Over toys and treats galore, scattered 'round the chamber floor—
> While I dreamt of mousey treasure, suddenly there came a measure,
> As of Zelda, my dear sister, scratching at the chamber door.
> "'Tis that troublemaker, Zelda," I muttered, scratching at the door—
> Only this and nothing more.
>
> Ah, how well I remember, in the sunny days of September,
> When the world outside seemed brighter than my old toy store.
> In that moment, eyes wide open, Zelda pleaded for a token,
> Of my snacks, her silence broken, as she scratched upon the door.
> Eagerly I debated, should I share or slam the door—
> Yearning for peace, nothing more.
>
> As I pondered this intrusion, filled with feline confusion,
> Zelda sauntered in unbidden, to explore my chamber floor.
> Not a purr or friendly greeting, just a stare that seemed repeating,
> "Mischief brewing, plans completing," she proclaimed without a roar.
> With a glance, she promised antics, 'round and 'round my chamber door—
> Zelda's tricks, and nothing more.
>
> In her gaze, a spark of madness, like a catnip-fueled gladness,
> With her antics, so absurd, she pranced across the floor.
> Though she spoke not, her intentions clear, mischief brewing, spirits near,
> As she danced, without a care, 'round and 'round my chamber door.
> With each twirl, a silent laughter, echoed 'round my chamber door—
> Zelda's schemes, and nothing more.
>
> Though I pondered her intentions, amidst dark feline conventions,
> Zelda cared not for my confessions, nor my plans to restore.
> Not a clue to her motive, not a hint to placate,
> Just a game, her wicked bait, 'round and 'round my chamber door.
> Round and round, her game continued, 'round and 'round my chamber door—
> Zelda's jests, and nothing more.
>
> As the sunlight dimmed its shimmer, casting shadows, growing grimmer,
> On the carpet, where she pranced, with a grin, she did implore.
> But her antics soon concluded, with a wink, she then eluded,
> Through the window, all deluded, up above my chamber door.
> Gone, but left her haunting spirit, dancing 'round my chamber door—
> Zelda's mischief, forevermore.
>
> So I sit here, musing deeply, pondering her antics steeply,
> As the shadows whisper softly, 'cross the carpet, 'cross the floor.
> Though her visit left me rattled, amidst laughter, midst the battle,
> Zelda's presence, like a riddle, dances 'round my chamber door.
> And I'll endure her memory, as she prances 'round my chamber door—
> Zelda's antics, forevermore.
