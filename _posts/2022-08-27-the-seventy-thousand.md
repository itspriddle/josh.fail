The Biden administration announced their student debt relief program this
week. Of course there are a lot of opinions on this, ranging from literal
tears of relief to outright rage over liberals getting another handout. I'm
one of those people who penny pinched for years to pay my loans off and I
think this is a great idea. Strap in for a story.

It's 2005 and you're pretty good at making websites. You know people pay for
this skill, but you can't seem to get your foot in the door anywhere. Right
now, you work at a gas station making $6.75 an hour. Your parents think a 20
year old needs a job or to enroll in school. _They've_ been told your entire
life that college is the key to the success they've never been able to
achieve.

Sick of working a shitty job and paying $50 a week in rent, you decide to
enroll in school. There's a local ITT campus about 40 minutes away that is
offering Web Development degrees. That seems to be a closer fit to the work
you hope to do one day than computer science. It's also only 2 years instead
of 4.

You randomly drive down to check it out after getting in another fight with
your mom about that $50. Before you know it, you are asking questions like
"what is my monthly payment going to be?" and not getting an answer. You're
only 20, and you're too dumb to know that you should never sign a loan without
knowing the monthly price, and that they totally could have calculated it for
you. You enroll anyway and wait a few days to tell your mom to fuck off on
rent day because you're now in college.

Months pass. You realize that this school is pretty lame and you know more
than they are teaching already. You think about dropping out, but then your
parents would just call you a drop out. So you keep your head down and pass
the classes.

Randomly, financial aid people hunt you down to sign another set of paperwork.
You don't realize quite how much everything is costing, just that your other
friends get access to the money to spend on things that aren't directly
through the school. They mention you should try to pay some of the interest if
you can to save money later. They don't tell you how compound interest works
or how much interest you've accrued so far.

You eventually get a tech support job in your field. You consider again
whether you should continue with a degree that isn't really teaching you much.
But, you assure yourself, having the degree will be worth it. At this point
the looming payment is starting to scare you, but that's still a year or so
away.

You finally graduate and have moved into a web development role. Life is good
for about 6 months! You're living on your own and getting by. Until you wake
up and get that first bill for $610 a month. You're making about $39,000 a
year, and seeing just about $1,000 in your paycheck every two weeks.

In a panic you call the loan company and tell them you can't pay that much.
They explain that they have options based on your income, and once I can
verify my salary, they can bring it down to about $415 a month. You're still
panicking. That's still a lot of money, but you aren't going to argue with a
$195 savings every month.

You make it work somehow for about year, not realizing that every month the
balance on that loan is actually going up. By a lot. It's probably a small
blessing you didn't know yet.

One day you find out you're done with your "easy" payment and now you have to
pay $630 a month, no ifs, ands, or buts. Oh, and since you've not actually
made any progress on the loan yet, you still have a full 120 payments to make
and the year and half of payments you've made so far did fuck all for your
actual loan balance.

You are really struggling now. You know you can't maintain even the modest
lifestyle you're used to, but you try anyway. Soon all of your bills are being
paid late every month. All of your credit cards are close to maxed. You
foolishly spend $25 at the gas station on a card with $945 on it. That puts
you over $950 which your bank arbitrarily decided is the max you get to spend
on your $1,000 limit card. They charge a $35 fee which puts you over your
$1,000 limit. They charge you another $35 for that.

You'd probably be crying but you're a man and men don't cry. They deal with
their own problems. You do the math and realize on the disposable income you
have, it'll take you 2 years to pay that card off. You try your best but when
the month is done, that card is still over it's limit. The bank calls you 45
times in a single day before you get paid to send them just enough to stop
bothering you. You really want to take that cry, but you suck it the fuck up
like a man.

You know you need to move back home to get out of the hole you're in. It takes
you about six months to finally admit to yourself. You feel like a shitty
friend to your roommate. And you feel like you've failed at 24 years old.

In spite of having a little extra money it's still hard to put a dent in any
of the debt. And every month, Sallie Mae is there to say "fuck you pay me".

You spend two years just barely scraping by. You don't know it yet, but your
credit score is pretty fucked because you have 7 months of 30 day late
payments reported. Luckily you _know_ you can't afford a car loan yet, so your
bad credit never actually bites you in the ass.

Finally you land a new job making $60,000 which feels absolutely life changing
in the moment. Just 3 short months after starting you are finally caught up
and can BREATHE!

You live a few years relatively stress free as far as finances are concerned.
Still, it takes you another 3 years to fix your credit score, and another 4
after that for all the derogatory marks you had to clear. You're thankful you
didn't really need to buy a house or car during this time.

You hear through the grape vine that the company you started at years ago
wanted to pass on you because of the name ITT. Frustrated and sad, you quietly
remove a black mark you never knew you had from your resume and LinkedIn.
You're still making those $630/month payments.

A few years later and you smile one day when you realize your net worth is a
positive number for the first time in your life. You realize you're even in a
spot where you can finally pay down the last $3,500. You do it in one payment
as one final small fuck you, as if the $30 they'd miss in interest somehow
makes it all worth it.

Fast forward another 4 years and you're hearing rumors of student debt
forgiveness. The idea kind of bugs you. You had to pay for your loans and it
was fucking hard! Why are people pursuing basket weaving degrees anyway? Why
is that my problem?

Ah well, you're not really convinced the politicians will do anything---wait,
did they just refund $3.2 billion with a b for _recent_ ITT graduates?! You
not only get no refund, but now that degree is _really_ not something to
advertise.

You wake up on a random weekday and read that Biden's actually gonna do it.
Your fianc√©e is almost in tears of relief now that her $25,000 has almost
disappeared overnight. You read countless stories online of other people in
similar or worse situations. You can feel the weight lifted from their
shoulders. It reminds you of that night you found out you got the first bill
for your school; what a failure you felt like when a $25 gas station trip went
sideways; how truly odd it was to wake up one day and realize you were
financially stable for the first time in your life.

So, yeah I'm pretty miffed still that I spent $70,000 on a $40,000 degree from
a disgraced institution. I'd LOVE to get a refund, believe me. I know I'm not
getting a dime, but that doesn't mean, I'm not _legit_ excited for so many
people to finally feel like they aren't drowning.
