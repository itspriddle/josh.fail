I took a ton of pictures today too. I went and took most of the shitty ones
off and between yesterday and today theres around 70 pics. Plus, I also
brought my Canon (which uses 35mm film) and snapped some shots from that.
Hopefully something good will come out.

Whenever someone sees me with a camera they either steal it from me Carly
style, or they cower in fear Brittany style. Check out DSC01857.JPG where poor
lil' Brit is jus' too bashful fo' the camera.
