I made the sign form for my guestbook, it took me fucking 3 hours. But its
perfect, and I fucking love it. Go there, and worship it. As for the guestbook
itself, wait a damn minute and I'll do it. Wait a damn week maybe.

Everyone (guys) have been asking me for the chicks. I suppose one day I'll
actually get a few on here for all of you.

There's parties every week for the next 4 weeks. I'm going to die, it'll be
fun.

Uh, yeah so nothing major here yet.
