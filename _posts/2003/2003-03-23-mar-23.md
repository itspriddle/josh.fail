Yeah so about 3 weeks after I thought I was done with everything I figured out
some font problems. I think I'm through all the major setbacks... I've got a
layout I like, the guestbooks working (and the interface actually matches the
rest of the site). I think everything's looking good for an April launch.

Follow-Up (10:25P):

I made a little picture in 3dstudio max for the bottom section. I'm going to
work on content for that tomorrow.
