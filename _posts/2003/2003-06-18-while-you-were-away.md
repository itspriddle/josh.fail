While I was on my ass doing nothing for the last 6 months, the domain name I
wanted became unavailible. I didn't do any of the stuff I said I was going to.
So this summer I decided: I'm not doing a fucking thing. At least this way in
September when nothing's been done I won't have to feel bad.

Follow-Up (10:07P):

Finished up some shit with the people pics, added Mike Bryk. Actually, his
shit's been online all along but I never got around to linking it.

Music: Scars of Life - Pool of Fears
