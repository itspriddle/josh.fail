My design portfolio is finally up. I've got a few more things to add to it,
but its basically finished.

I'm gonna finish up some minor stuff with the people pictures then chicks.

I've been adding new affiliates left and right, guess I'm going to have to
make a links page soon.

I'm going to get some bitches up here as soon as I can, because I know that's
what everyone is really looking for.

Check out the affiliates, because they're web losers just like me who get off
on high traffic.
