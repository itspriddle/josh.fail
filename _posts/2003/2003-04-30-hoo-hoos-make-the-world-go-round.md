To any 14 year old little wankers (or perfectly normal 18 year olds) out there
with a friend who is stacked and $200 laying around, I suggest you go out and
buy a digital camera.

Who doesn't love them?

Follow-Up (9:40P):

On a site related note, I'm about 95% done with the image galleries. And I'm
looking for a complete launch around May 5.
