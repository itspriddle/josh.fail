Sorry for the lack of updates, I got 500 viruses as a present the other day.
To anyone who thinks you dont need a virus scan, fuck you, instal one. Youre
fucked if you get shit and dont have one. Yeah I get to reformat my computer
again for the 2nd time this month. I don't know if this site will ever be
finished, but I've been hating on Flash so maybe I'll have a Flash version???
(Yeah, I've said that about 650 times before...)
