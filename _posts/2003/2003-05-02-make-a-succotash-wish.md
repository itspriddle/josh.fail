Alien Ant Farm is actually pretty good. Haha, I love the Michael Jackson
cover, but thats just because I'm a loser who likes shit from the 80's.

I got my tuxedo today for the prom, which is on May 16th. I'm going with Brit
again. No Jamie this year though =( so I'm not the pimp anymore... The party
after is supposed to be the shit, but I dunno. So many people have known about
it for so long that there'll surely be cops waiting at the house for us. Yeah
Galway... we rent state troopers because our 1 cop got fired. Gotta love it.
