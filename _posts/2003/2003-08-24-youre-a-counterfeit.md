I am too lazy to ever really finish this site, although I might update once in
a while. I'm sick of seeing this layout, to be perfectly honest with you. I'm
glad I made this though, because I learned tricks that I'm using now that are
(hopefully) going to get me some money.

Me and Tony have been making a site lately, and everytime we work on it it
just gets better. Dethroned.Nevercraft Productions will be out soon.
