title: "PHP Coding: Phase 01"
category: vault

The basic layout of this site is done, which means, the graphics side is
finished. There is still tons of PHP coding left, maybe a few experiments with
PHP/MySQL. Still need to get a guestbook written in PHP. There are a lot of
things left to do, but theres something pretty at least for you all to look
at.

I apologize for any errors you might find while this site is in its
preliminary launch stage.
