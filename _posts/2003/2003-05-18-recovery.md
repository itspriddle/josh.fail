Well, prom was both good and bad. The party after at Lisa's house was fucking
insane. Some kid I didn't know knew who I was and it was freaking me out.
Well, maybe it was just the toxins in my brain at the time... He ended up
sleeping with his head on a wooden kitchen table because he puked and passed
out. I thought it was hillarious. And then the fucking green monster. Oh shit,
you had to be there to know what I'm talking about. It was cool, and were all
going back in 4 weeks for graduation.

Then yesterday me, Brit, Josh & Ashley, and Tyler and his little chic went to
see the Matrix Reloaded at the Drive-In. Holy shit, those things are so
fucking old, but its the shit. The Matrix kicked ass, but some of the CG was
crappy looking. I was kind of disappointed. And then Malibu's Most Wanted was
on after, Jamie Kennedy should kill himself. It was horrible. DO NOT watch it.
