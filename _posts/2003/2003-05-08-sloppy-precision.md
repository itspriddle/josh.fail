I haven't done shit in a week. Prom is next Friday tho.

Brit and I aren't going to match at all. That's really alright because the
clothes just come off at the end of the night anyway, right Brit??

Chicks soon all my shadowness buddies (and Sean & Ry), I promise! Some
pictures soon, hopefully, who knows. I've got so much shit going on at the end
of the year so who knows if it'll get done by summer.
