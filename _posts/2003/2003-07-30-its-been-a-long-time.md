Alot has happened in the last month, although nothing really new here. I
bought www.nevercraft.net, finally. Nothing going on there either.

I graduated last month, so high school's out of the way, but I still haven't
found a job. I'm looking for design work, and me and Tony will be placing an
ad in the newspaper to get as many projects as we can.

We're also thinking about a Dethroned-Nevercraft Studio of some sort...but we
haven't figured any of the details out yet.
