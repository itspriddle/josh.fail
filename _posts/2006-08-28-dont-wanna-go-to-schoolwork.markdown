title: Don't wanna go to school/work...
---

I truly hate VT from midnight to 8am...  If I'm lucky I __won't__ come in to
10 people on hold with hour+ wait times...  If I'm lucky, they __won't__ call
at all and I'll be able to get some tickets done.

**I'm not lucky - I never have been.**

To top it off - or rather, lay the foundation of the cake, I get to go to ITT
first.

Awesome, I hate that place all the time...  I'm almost done with this quarter
though.

Going to do HW and hate life for 12 hours.
