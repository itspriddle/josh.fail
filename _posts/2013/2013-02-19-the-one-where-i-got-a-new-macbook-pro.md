Today, I finally got a new MacBook Pro with Retina Display to replace my aging
early-2009 model.

This thing is **FAST**. I went with the 2.7GHz model (which peaks at 3.7GHz
with Turbo Boost), that also includes 16GB of RAM and a 512GB SSD.

Opening programs happens nearly instantly. Restarting the computer takes about
15 seconds. On some projects I work on, running the test suite is almost 2
minutes faster!

Oh, then there's the screen...
