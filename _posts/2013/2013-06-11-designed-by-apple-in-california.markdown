The new [Designed by Apple](http://www.apple.com/designed-by-apple/)
commercial is absolutely brilliant.

> This is it.  
> This is what matters.  
> The experience of a product.  
> How it makes someone feel.  
> When you start by imagining  
> What that might be like,  
> You step back.  
> You think.
>
> Who will this help?  
> Will it make life better?  
> Does this deserve to exist?  
> If you are busy making everything,  
> How can you perfect anything?  
>
> We don't believe in coincidence.  
> Or dumb luck.  
> There are a thousand "no's"  
> For every "yes."  
> We spend a lot of time  
> On a few great things.  
> Until every idea we touch  
> Enhances each life it touches.
>
> We’re engineers and artists.  
> Craftsmen and inventors.  
> We sign our work.  
> You may rarely look at it.  
> But you’ll always feel it.  
> This is our signature.  
> And it means everything.  
>
