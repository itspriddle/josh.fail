title: "More OS X Hints"
---

I just came across [this
list](http://mac.appstorm.net/roundups/utilities-roundups/40-super-secret-os-x-lion-features-and-shortcuts/)
of OS X Lion tricks and tips. A few I didn't know about yet, such as Tip #22,
resizing windows with Shift and Option.

I've been using OS X for [a few years](/blog/2008/osx-first-impressions.html),
I love that I'm still learning new things about it.
