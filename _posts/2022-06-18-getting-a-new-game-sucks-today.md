Getting a new game sucks today. Back in my day, we had booklets to read by
street light on the drive home from Toys 'R Us. You popped the game in, and
if your room was clean, you were ready to rock. No console updates. No
installing files to disk. No downloading game updates. Just you, your shiny
new game, and a soda.

On that note, I finally grabbed Red Dead Redemption II. If it ever finishes
installing, I hope it is as good as everyone says.

A more positive note, some of the better new game memories I have:

- Metal Gear Solid (Sony PlayStation): I remember getting the PS1 without any
  games for Christmas and then having to wait a month until getting one for my
  birthday. Thankfully, Sony included a sweet sampler with the intro to Metal
  Gear Solid, along with the first bits of Spyro and MediEvil. When I finally
  got it, my mom made me clean my room first. Let me tell you, I'd never
  cleaned that room so fast before. I still remember being stuck on the cyborg
  ninja for days, and how great it felt to finally kick his ass 10 mins before
  lights out.
- Sonic The Hedgehog 3 (Sega Genesis): This was probably the first game I
  remember waiting to come out. It was also the first game I bought myself. I
  dutifully called every toy store in town and gave them my entire name and
  address before asking if they had Sonic 3 for sale and at what price. Ah,
  kids on the phone. I remember being blown away by the first levels when I
  tried it for the first time. I also remember spending an entire Saturday
  filling out the 6 save slots with 100% complete games, just to say I could.
  Sadly, the battery in the cartridge died and it stopped saving games. I was
  never able to get it fixed.
- Starflight (Sega Genesis): This is a game most of my gamer buddies have
  never heard of. I actually wasn't big into it when I first got it. It wasn't
  until after I'd gotten bored of Sonic, Road Rash, and Desert Strike that I
  finally moved on to the one last game I had at the time. What finally sucked
  me in, was the game manual. It was about 200 pages and included a small
  novella in the form of a log book from the previous captain of the game's
  ship. I must have put hundreds of hours into different attempts to complete
  Starflight. And I read that book at least 20 times until it had a tattered
  cover. If I could get one piece of my gaming stuff back, it would definitely
  be the Starflight manual.
- Sonic The Hedgehog 2 (Sega Genesis): I don't remember actually getting the
  game. I do remember struggling to beat Sonic 1, and my dad telling me to
  keep at it and he'd buy me the 2nd copy when I finished. I spent weeks
  trying. When I finally did it, I called my dad at work and was ready for him
  to come pick me up and bring me to the mall.
