I just [read][1] that Bram Moolenaar, the creator and BDFL of Vim, passed away
on Thursday ðŸ˜¢.

I never met him but I've been using Vim since 2007 so he's indirectly been a
huge part of my professional life.

I'm sure Vim isn't going anywhere, and NeoVim is obviously there if Vim
development should cease. Still, this news hits hard for me for some reason.

Best wishes to Bram's family and the people who worked with him on Vim.

Thanks for the awesome editor, Bram! RIP.
