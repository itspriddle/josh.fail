I just discovered [Marked](http://markedapp.com/) today. It adds one of the
few things I still miss from TextMate to vim, a live preview window for
markdown.

Just add this to your `vimrc` and you can `<leader>m` in any markdown buffer
to see a rendered preview:

    autocmd FileType markdown,liquid nnoremap <buffer> <leader>m :silent !open -a Marked.app '%:p'<cr>
