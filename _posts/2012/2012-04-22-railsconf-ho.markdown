Beyond excited to be attending Railsconf in Austin, TX this year! Can't wait
to finally meet the rest of [Site5 Engineering team](http://www.eng5.com/) in
person. If you're at any of the bars afterward, make sure to flag down Site5
for a drink!

Incidentally, I wonder why the TSA recommends you arrive two hours early for a
flight when it took me all of 5 minutes to clear security.
