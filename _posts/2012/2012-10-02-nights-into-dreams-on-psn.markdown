title: "NiGHTS into dreams on PSN"
---

Today, Sega re-released one of my favorite childhood games from Sega Saturn:
[NiGHTS into DREAMS...](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nights_into_Dreams...).

When I was 12 I spent hours playing this game, memorizing the
maps, and trying to get the highest scores I could.

The PSN remake retains all of its 1996-charm. In fact, it includes high def
and original Sega Saturn graphics. The original graphics look a bit dated
on a high def television, but this game is still seriously fun.
