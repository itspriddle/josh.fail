Today, Sega [re-released][1] one of my favorite childhood games from Sega
Saturn: [NiGHTS into DREAMS...][2].

When I was 12 I spent hours playing this game, memorizing the maps, and trying
to get the highest scores I could.

The PSN remake retains all of its 1996-charm. In fact, it includes high def
and original Sega Saturn graphics. The original graphics look a bit dated on a
high def television, but this game is still seriously fun.
