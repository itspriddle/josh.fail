# My Projects

> I don't even see the code. All I see is blonde, brunette, red-head.

I'm constantly hacking on something. This is a list of projects that may be
useful to someone else. Checkout my [GitHub](https://github.com/itspriddle)
some other tasty nuggets.

## WHMCS API Bindings

I extracted work with [DotBlock](http://www.dotblock.com/) and released PHP
and Ruby wrappers for the WHMCS API. View source on GitHub for the
[Ruby](https://github.com/dotblock/whmcs-ruby) or
[PHP](https://github.com/dotblock/whmcs-php) versions.


## CodeIgniter ActionMailer

I missed ActionMailer from Ruby on Rails and started hacking up something
similar for use with CodeIgniter apps. I gave it just enough love to be
useful before I decided to use Rails for the app I was planning on
using it with.

ActiveMailbox to make my life a little easier.
