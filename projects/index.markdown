## CodeIgniter ActionMailer (PHP library)

I missed ActionMailer from Ruby on Rails and started hacking up something
similar for use with CodeIgniter apps. I gave it just enough love to be
useful before I decided to use Rails for the app I was planning on
using it with.

# Other Stuff I've Worked On

> Round, round, get around. I get around, yeah.

Sometimes people pay me to code or design for them. Here are a few projects
I've worked on with previous employers and clients.


## Ennouncement

While at ViaTalk, I wrote the backend Rails application that powers
Ennouncement.com, a call broadcasting service. I also wrote Ennouncement
Mobile, an iPhone application for Ennouncement users.
[Go to Ennouncement.com &rarr;](http://www.ennouncement.com/)


## Let's Call Santa

One of my favorite ViaTalk projects, Let's Call Santa gives children a way to
call Santa and leave a personalized voicemail with their wishlist. The
voicemail is then delivered to parents via email so they can make sure to get
everything their kids want for Christmas.

I created a PHP-based site for the service in 2009, and rewrote it in Rails in
2010 to add new features.
