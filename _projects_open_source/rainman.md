Rainman was a RubyGem implementing the abstract factory pattern in Rails
applications' service objects. It was a premature abstraction and development
was abandoned when I realized it was adding unnecessary complexity to
projects. I consider Rainman a successful failure that was a valuable lesson
in knowing when to abstract.
