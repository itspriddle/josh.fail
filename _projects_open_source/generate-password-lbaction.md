generate-password.lbaction is a [LaunchBar 6][] Action to generate secure
passwords and copy them to the system clipboard.

It uses the [KeePass Password Generator][] to allow you to specify a character
set for the generated password. This functionality is provided by an included
copy of the [keepass-password-generator RubyGem][] -- no external dependencies
are required.
