Wormhole is a custom built RubyGem that is used to export customer billing
information from WHMCS into our in-house billing system, Helix. I created the
initial implementation and oversaw the successful migration of several
thousand clients from WHMCS into Helix. The library was created using Ruby,
PostgreSQL and MySQL.
