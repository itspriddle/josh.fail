Helix is a custom built billing system that is used by staff and customers to
manage web hosting services. I have been a lead developer on this project
since it's inception. I helped create and deploy the initial implementation,
including the UI, while at World Wide Web Hosting, and currently maintain it
with the software engineering team at Pressed. The application was designed
using Ruby on Rails, PostgreSQL, jQuery, Coffeescript, and SCSS on top of AWS.
Helix also includes several supplemental Rails applications and Ruby gems
which I helped implement and deploy. <!--_See full [case study][]_. -->
