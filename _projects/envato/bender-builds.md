Bender Builds is a project to automate the installation of WordPress themes
and plugins for customers of Envato Hosted. It allows administrators to
quickly bundle themes and their dependencies, providing near-instant website
setup for new customers. On the backend, Capybara simulates a WordPress
installation, including plugin installation and general configuration. The
Hosted billing system coordinates the build process for each theme. I worked
on a large portion of the backend project responsible for packaging the
themes, and I implemented integration with this system into the Hosted billing
system.
