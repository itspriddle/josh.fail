iZabbix is an iPhone application used internally by VoIP engineers to receive
alerts from Zabbix. The iPhone application was designed using Appcelerator
Titanium. The supporting API was designed using Ruby on Rails and is
responsible for relaying alerts from Zabbix to users' phones using a custom
built RubyGem to communicate with the Apple Push Notification Service.
