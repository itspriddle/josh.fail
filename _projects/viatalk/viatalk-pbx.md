ViaTalk PBX is an VoIP/web application that powers support calls for ViaTalk,
HostRocket, and DotBlock. The application handles routing incoming calls to
support queues, call detail record logging, and displaying an overview of past
and current calls. I was responsible for the entire application including
server setup and maintenance. The backend VoIP application was designed using
Asterisk and MySQL. The web application was designed using PHP, CodeIgniter,
and MySQL. ViaTalk PBX served 500-1000 of daily support calls and had nearly
perfect uptime under my care.

<!--
**Biggest Challenge:** I handled _everything_ on this project: setting up and
securing the server, installing and configuring Asterisk, and developing and
deploying the web application.

**Biggest Triumph:** Stability and performance were massively improved.
