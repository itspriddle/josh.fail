I developed 3 major versions of the company website for Creative Dance Arts
over the course of 11 years, including two custom WordPress themes. The I
trained the Artistic Director on the use of WordPress to manage the site's
content and monitor visitors. I also provided support for the site's 200+
users when classes were in session.
