MWP Admin Impersonation allows staff and customers to securely sign in to
WordPress Admin from the Envato Hosted Rails applications --- without the need
for a password. I created the WordPress plugin that handles authentication and
oversaw its deployment to the Hosted platform, and also integrated it with the
Hosted Rails applications.
