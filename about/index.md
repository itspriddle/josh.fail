I'm Josh. I make web hosting and web hosting accessories.

I've been working on SaaS apps since 2006 (before we called 'em "SaaS apps").
I mainly program in Ruby, PHP, and Bash.

I've written a bit about some of the [professional][] and [open source][] work
I've done.

These days I lead the Software Development team at [A2 Hosting][].
