title: Oh Hai, Jekyll
---
After putting it off for too long, I've redesigned my blog
using [Jekyll](http://github.com/mojombo/jekyll) and [GitHub Pages](http://pages.github.com).
It ended up being a lot easier than I thought, and Jekyll can do some pretty sweet stuff.

Soon, I'll be posting the steps I took to make a simple search box for my posts. Stay tuned.
